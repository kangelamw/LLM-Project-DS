Concisely, how can we best improve our services for this customer's experience?\n\n##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a elementary school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a neutral tone.\n\nAnswer:\nIn the world of customer service, it is important to understand how customers feel when they have a negative experience. This can help us improve our services and make our customers happier. One way to measure customer satisfaction is by using a tool called the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI). The CSI is a number that tells us how satisfied customers are with a company or product.\n\nTo calculate the CSI, we need to know the number of customers who are satisfied, neutral, or dissatisfied."

Cover Charge: If applicable, make it clearer that a cover charge is required for entry, especially for special events like the NCAA football championship game.

Streamline Check-in Process: Improve the check-in process to ensure that all reservations are accounted for and any issues are resolved promptly. 4. Compensation: When issues arise, offer prompt and fair compensation to the customers."

This can help us improve our services and make our customers happier. One way to measure customer satisfaction is by using a tool called the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI).

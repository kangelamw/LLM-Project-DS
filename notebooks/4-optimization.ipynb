To improve the customer's experience, we could focus on modernizing the ambiance of our establishment to make it less reminiscent of an old casino. This could involve updating the decor, improving the lighting, and potentially enhancing the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the venue. Additionally, we could consider offering incentives or promotions to make the extra travel time to reach our location more appealing, such as discounts on food, drinks, or activities. Lastly, ensuring excellent customer service and a welcoming atmosphere could help create a more positive impression and encourage repeat visits."

The NPS is a simple question that asks customers to rate their likelihood of recommending a product or service to others on a scale of 0 to 10. The NPS is based on the idea that customers who are promoters are more likely to recommend a product or service, while customers who are detractors are less likely to do so. By calculating the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors, we can determine the overall NPS score."

This will maintain the integrity of the establishment and adhere to legal requirements. 2. Cover Charge: If applicable, make it clearer that a cover charge is required for entry, especially for special events like the NCAA football championship game.

Communication: Improve communication by keeping customers informed about any changes or delays in their orders. 3. Availability: Clearly communicate if the service (in this case, delivery) is not available during certain times or under specific circumstances. 4.

Empathy: Show empathy towards customers when there are delays or issues with their orders.",
         "In the world of customer service, it is important to understand how customers feel about the products and services they receive. One way to measure this is by using a tool called the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS is a simple question that asks customers to rate their likelihood of recommending a product or service to others on a scale of 0 to 10. The NPS is based on the idea that customers who are promoters are more likely to recommend a product or service, while customers who are detractors are less likely to do so. By calculating the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors, we can determine the overall NPS score.",

    "**BERTScore -- Better Contextual Similarity**\n",
    "- Phi-2’s outputs are now even more similar to Mistral’s outputs in terms of contextual word representations.\n",
    "- Since BERTScore evaluates word embeddings rather than exact word matches, this indicates that Phi-2 is better capturing the meaning and phrasing of Mistral.\n",
    "\n",
    "**METEOR better, but still low -- More Exact Matches & Better Paraphrasing**\n",
    "- Phi-2 now has better word choice, phrasing, and synonym matches.\n",
    "- Since METEOR gives extra weight to synonyms and paraphrases, this suggests Phi-2 is generating responses that more closely match Mistral’s structure\n",

    "### Fine-tuned Model: Summary of Eval\n",
    "Phi-2's semantic understanding of what needs to be done has improved. The fine-tuning process has led to better semantic alignment and contextual similarity, as shown by the improvements in BLEURT, BERTScore, and METEOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Phi-2 now mirrors Mistral’s responses more effectively, there is still room for improvement. BLEURT is still negative, indicating that some fine-grained semantic details might be missing. Further refinements could help Phi-2 align even more closely with Mistral’s outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is great in a way that maybe an extra round of training with 1-2k more rows per training would get it on par with Mistral's. I have about 14k/2k of train/test I could use yet."

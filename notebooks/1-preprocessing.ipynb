I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money."

I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\nI took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire \\\"this time\\\". \\nI will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!"

It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."

The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh."

It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around.",

My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!!

There weren't any booths offering anything to do with Brazil. There were streamers in yellow and green and that was the extent of the decorations. The schedules were preprinted which was good...but it's not like there was anything to do other than eat, drink or watch the stage. And it was very hot outside. The portion that was supposed to be $8 of Brazilian food was small and cold. And there was only one line to order and one line to pick up. Seems like if this is the 5th annual event, there would be more attention to details. It was even hot inside the building and I really don't know what Jui jitsu has to do with Brazil.

                  "here's what happened n we were suppose to be at the regular mgm.. so we pulled up, put our car in valet, got a bell boy to take our stuff.. and then we realized they gave us rooms at the signature. what a pain!!!! n then when we tried to check in we were suppose to have 2 rooms... but they couldn't find our other reservation because we booked through an online travel company so they only gave us one room!!! n the next day we had to spend at least an hour trying to get compensated for the room that we pre paid for! finally they gave us back the money and also said they would give us 200 to spend on food and bev. n so, we ordered 158 in food that night... and tipped 30! n then when i went to check out... they had all the room service charges and all the room charges on my card!!! it was such a hassle to get them off!!! in the end, they took off all charges but the 30 tip which i was still mad about . n nthe rooms were super nice! they had a nice kitchen and a nice view. but, i do not consider it much of an upgrade from the mgm since one of the beds is a pull out couch. n nalso, we were there for a bachelorette party... and the bachelorette likes to gamble.. so it probably would have been more ideal to stay in the casino. n noverall, the condo was very nice... but the customer service was totally disorganized and bad. numerous times the signature blamed their poor service on the mgm and said they couldn't do anything about our problems since we booked through the mgm.",

There weren't any booths offering anything to do with Brazil. There were streamers in yellow and green and that was the extent of the decorations. The schedules were preprinted which was good...but it's not like there was anything to do other than eat, drink or watch the stage. And it was very hot outside. The portion that was supposed to be $8 of Brazilian food was small and cold. And there was only one line to order and one line to pick up. Seems like if this is the 5th annual event, there would be more attention to details. It was even hot inside the building and I really don't know what Jui jitsu has to do with Brazil.

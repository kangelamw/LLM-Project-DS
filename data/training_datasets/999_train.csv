2767," A customer left us a 2-star review: 'we were incredibly disappointed by this installment from chef ramsay and we expected a lot more from a place with his name. it was very crowded, probably about 8 o'clock on a tuesday night. they were out of at least half of the items on their menu, including basic staples like pies and drinks. our server failed to tell us anything and overall was not very pleasant. the food runners were rude and sort of ignored us. nthe food itself wasn't good i had a warm chicken sandwich that might have been decent if it wasn't overwhelmed with gruyere cheese to the point where the bread was soggy and the cheese was all we could taste. the rest of my party was only marginally satisfied with their food. the only good part of the experience was the nice interior. maybe we came at a bad time, but ni wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. it doesn't live up to ramsay's standards in the slightest.'

5217," A customer left us a 1-star review: 'poor service is putting it too kindly. in fact in this day and age, i can rightly fully say it was downright racism. they weren't even subtle about it. we walked in on a friday night and they were fairly busy but we were seated within 10 minutes. however, it quickly went downhill from there. n nthe server came by fairly quickly, but we still needed some time with the menu. but then, she decided not to come back.. even after we summoned her. and yet she had time to serve and make chit chat with the people at the tables around us. then, after she finally came by and taking our orders, for another 15 minutes we never saw our drinks or anything else. so i asked her again for our drinks, after seeing her refill the glasses of several of our neighbors, she dismissed me with he will get it for you when he is free pointing at the table busser . now he clearly didn't get her message, as he was standing around looking for people to refill their water glasses. and so at that point, after more than three incidents of non service, we just ditched the place. n nso you're wondering where the racism was? bad service was bad service right? well, when the asian server in a chinese restaurant is diligently serving everyone else who were all white and just paying my table 2 chinese americans lip service, well that just smacks of dining in the segregated deep south in the 60s. n ni hope one never has to experience that kind of treatment here or anywhere else. but you have to wonder... if they do this to someone, could they do this to you? even if you've never gotten the same treatment, how would you feel about this establishment knowing that they discriminate?'

276," A customer left us a 2-star review: 'the pizza was dry and bland! ni went to the restaurant based on the good reviews. i ordered a slice of the buffalo chicken pizza, based on a recommendation from the girl at the counter. unfortunatly, i was very disappointed by the pizza. it was a thin style new york pizza with a proper crispy bottom that could hold up to lifting the slice off the plate, so it deserved that level of appreciation. however, the chicken was blantenly overcooked, and the entire slice was bland. i don't know how that is possible with a spicy element like buffalo sauce. all in all, there are much better pizza restaurant all throughout the city.'

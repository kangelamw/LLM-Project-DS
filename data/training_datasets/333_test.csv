To improve the customer's experience, consider adjusting the consistency of the clam chowder to be more like a traditional chowder, rather than a potato soup. This could be achieved by reducing the amount of cream or thickeners used. Additionally, sourcing larger oysters might be appreciated, as the customer mentioned they were on the smaller side. Lastly, consider enhancing the ambiance of the seating area to create a more comfortable and inviting atmosphere for diners."

Offer a choice between a regular TV channel and a channel that broadcasts the cult's programming. This would allow customers who are not interested in the cult's message to avoid it during their dining experience. 3. Train staff to be sensitive to customers' preferences and feelings about religious or philosophical discussions."

1,"So in all fairness, the course was actually very nice, but the rating is for the staff at the course.  I was playing with several friends who were new to golf, hence a par 3 executive course.  We were a slow going group, but we offered several times to let the twosome behind us play through.  They said they were fine to play behind us and were entertained by us.  All was good, and the course was nice for a par 3.  But the course marshall was an idiot.  On the 17th hole (read that again....the 17th hole), he rides up in his cart, actually picks up one of our balls in play from our tee shots, and rides up to our group and says we need to observe rate of play.  I told him it's the 17th hole, we've already teed off, so really, not a lot we can do at that point.  He was a jerk and gave us attitude.  If he had actually done his job he would have talked to us about the 5th hole.

2. Offer a solution: Suggest a complimentary meal or a discount on their next visit to give them a chance to try our food again and hopefully have a better experience.

3. Address specific concerns: If possible, investigate the issues they mentioned (e.g., bad seafood and meat dishes) and take steps to improve the quality of those dishes."
1,"Another sold-out show at The Fillmore and another brutal disappointment.  This place cannot, I repeat, cannot manage a big crowd.  Period.  I tried to go into it with an open mind since my last review apparently ruffled a few feathers, but I'm sad to report that nothing has changed or improved since my last visit in August.  This place is a cluster fuck and that's putting it nicely.  The poor, poor design of locating the bathrooms all the way  in the back on the right side basically resulted in a total bottle neck of people pushing and shoving their way down the two stairs that lead from the bar at the top to the bathrooms and smoking area down below.  The security staff, instead of helping people get through and easing the crowded mass, decided to shine their flashlights in everyone's faces while standing against the rail, arms crossed over their chests, looking like a bunch of worthless thugs.  Any attempt to get into the actual bathroom area was often quickly thwarted by someone yelling at you to stay out of the fire lane even though you are simply attempting to get out of the way to help everyone else actually be able to move.  The staff here is the WORST EVER.  That ranges from security to bartenders and everywhere in between.  I've been to smaller venues all over the country that have had bigger crowds and managed them more efficiently.  I made the mistake of giving it another try and I definitely will not be back again after this nightmare.  Sorry Dave.","another sold out show at the fillmore and another brutal disappointment. this place cannot, i repeat, cannot manage a big crowd. period. i tried to go into it with an open mind since my last review apparently ruffled a few feathers, but i'm sad to report that nothing has changed or improved since my last visit in august. this place is a cluster fuck and that's putting it nicely. the poor, poor design of locating the bathrooms all the way in the back on the right side basically resulted in a total bottle neck of people pushing and shoving their way down the two stairs that lead from the bar at the top to the bathrooms and smoking area down below. the security staff, instead of helping people get through and easing the crowded mass, decided to shine their flashlights in everyone's faces while standing against the rail, arms crossed over their chests, looking like a bunch of worthless thugs. any attempt to get into the actual bathroom area was often quickly thwarted by someone yelling at you to stay out of the fire lane even though you are simply attempting to get out of the way to help everyone else actually be able to move. the staff here is the worst ever. that ranges from security to bartenders and everywhere in between. i've been to smaller venues all over the country that have had bigger crowds and managed them more efficiently. i made the mistake of giving it another try and i definitely will not be back again after this nightmare. sorry dave.",264,"disappointment, sadness, annoyance","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'another sold out show at the fillmore and another brutal disappointment. this place cannot, i repeat, cannot manage a big crowd. period. i tried to go into it with an open mind since my last review apparently ruffled a few feathers, but i'm sad to report that nothing has changed or improved since my last visit in august. this place is a cluster fuck and that's putting it nicely. the poor, poor design of locating the bathrooms all the way in the back on the right side basically resulted in a total bottle neck of people pushing and shoving their way down the two stairs that lead from the bar at the top to the bathrooms and smoking area down below. the security staff, instead of helping people get through and easing the crowded mass, decided to shine their flashlights in everyone's faces while standing against the rail, arms crossed over their chests, looking like a bunch of worthless thugs. any attempt to get into the actual bathroom area was often quickly thwarted by someone yelling at you to stay out of the fire lane even though you are simply attempting to get out of the way to help everyone else actually be able to move. the staff here is the worst ever. that ranges from security to bartenders and everywhere in between. i've been to smaller venues all over the country that have had bigger crowds and managed them more efficiently. i made the mistake of giving it another try and i definitely will not be back again after this nightmare. sorry dave.'

1,"My girlfriend has been raving about the Rainforest Cafe and her experiences that she has had with them in Chicago, so when we saw one was available at the MGM Grand (which is just a quick walk from the Excalibur where we're staying), I got a bit excited based on that.\n\nBeing inside the MGM Grand, I expected expensive but the cheapest meal item I found was $15+. That's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink. The waiter seemed nice and offered me a margarita or beer. A margarita would have cost $11 to start so I just ordered a Coke (which was $3 I believe.) I ordered the appetizer sampler because it seemed I'd at least get quite a bit of food for my money.\n\nNow, I knew that the reason for the expense would be the convenience of being inside the MGM Grand and the 'show' that is put on by being surrounded by a \""rainforest\"" of sorts. The entire thing is animatronic and features a storm that goes off every half hour or so. Honestly, I found the whole thing laughably cheesy and couldn't believe this is what we were paying extra for. The entire thing would have been impressive If I was much younger and living in the 1980's.... MAYBE.\n\nAs for the quality of service, it was mediocre at best. The table next to us was seated and ordered later, but had their drinks refilled before mine. The waiter often disappeared and it took my girlfriend asking him to get drinks refilled.

To improve the customer's experience, we should focus on three key areas: prompt seating, proactive communication, and attentive service.

1. Prompt seating: Ensure that customers are seated promptly upon arrival, ideally within a few minutes. This can be achieved by having a system in place to quickly identify and seat waiting customers.

1,"I kind of liked Kobe. The teppanyaki has always been great. The sushi is often hit or miss. I used to be a somewhat regular there, living through the meh sushi to get the good. What stopped me going there completely, besides discovering Sushi Eye not even a mile away, was an event that happened one Saturday. My husband and I were sitting at the bar like we always did when an off-duty waitress showed up with a puppy she had just purchased. Not only did she take the dog to the sushi bar, but stood right next to us at the end of the bar so the sushi chefs could pet her new pooch.

The customer feels disappointment, neutral, annoyance. Concisely, how can we best improve our services for this customer's experience?  1. Improve seating and order management: Ensure that orders are taken promptly after seating, and that orders are properly associated with the correct table.

2. Train staff on food preparation: Ensure that food is cooked to the specified level (in this case, medium well steak should not be medium rare).

3. Cleanliness: Regularly clean and maintain the kitchen equipment, especially the grill, to prevent food from being cooked on a dirty surface.

4. Staffing: Ensure that there is an adequate number of staff members to handle the number of customers, so that servers are not overwhelmed and can provide prompt and attentive service."

1,"Warning:  This is NOT a Japanese restaurant, its a KOREAN restaurant pretending to be Japanese.  Went to eat here and quickly discovered this ruse.  The previous owners/staff that you see in the pics are gone, sold out.\n\nWhy is this important - if your going to pay $250 for two people you want the real thing, not pretenders using pretend Japanese and who arenot Sushi chefs.  Japanese chefs are trained for a decade to do their job right.

3. Hire a sushi chef: If possible, hire a sushi chef who has been trained in Japan or by a Japanese master."
1,We heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it. The menu looked amazing and we came hungry. I ordered kalua pig Benedict and my husband ordered adobo fried rice with Mac salad. Both were not good at all! The kalua pig Benedict was kalua pig and CABBAGE Benedict...totally gross no taste from the kalua pig and the English muffin on the bottom was soggy from water...if it was soggy from like a tasty liquid that would've been different but it wasn't. The adobo fried rice was junk. If you are from Hawaii and know good adobo fried this was not even close. We thought aloha kitchen AFR was junk this was worse. The Mac salad was DISGUSTING to say the very least. It had no taste and the macaroni tasted old. It was like soaked (not boiled) macaroni in a watery white substance. I gave this one star because we also ordered the red velvet pancakes and although it was a little dry it did taste good. We also got a side of zippy's chili which was about an ounce for $2.75 that tasted good (like zippys chili) so our bill came out to $47 and some cents and we were Very Very disappointed to have to pay that much for such a crappy meal.,we heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it. the menu looked amazing and we came hungry. i ordered kalua pig benedict and my husband ordered adobo fried rice with mac salad. both were not good at all! the kalua pig benedict was kalua pig and cabbage benedict...totally gross no taste from the kalua pig and the english muffin on the bottom was soggy from water...if it was soggy from like a tasty liquid that would've been different but it wasn't. the adobo fried rice was junk. if you are from hawaii and know good adobo fried this was not even close. we thought aloha kitchen afr was junk this was worse. the mac salad was disgusting to say the very least. it had no taste and the macaroni tasted old. it was like soaked not boiled macaroni in a watery white substance. i gave this one star because we also ordered the red velvet pancakes and although it was a little dry it did taste good. we also got a side of zippy's chili which was about an ounce for 2.75 that tasted good like zippys chili so our bill came out to 47 and some cents and we were very very disappointed to have to pay that much for such a crappy meal.,221,"disapproval, disappointment, annoyance","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'we heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it. the menu looked amazing and we came hungry. i ordered kalua pig benedict and my husband ordered adobo fried rice with mac salad. both were not good at all! the kalua pig benedict was kalua pig and cabbage benedict...totally gross no taste from the kalua pig and the english muffin on the bottom was soggy from water...if it was soggy from like a tasty liquid that would've been different but it wasn't. the adobo fried rice was junk. if you are from hawaii and know good adobo fried this was not even close. we thought aloha kitchen afr was junk this was worse. the mac salad was disgusting to say the very least. it had no taste and the macaroni tasted old. it was like soaked not boiled macaroni in a watery white substance. i gave this one star because we also ordered the red velvet pancakes and although it was a little dry it did taste good. we also got a side of zippy's chili which was about an ounce for 2.75 that tasted good like zippys chili so our bill came out to 47 and some cents and we were very very disappointed to have to pay that much for such a crappy meal.'

1,"So I saw the Martinez taco bar in the middle of a nice little shopping center and I thought why not let's give it a try, I enjoy new things. It was rush hour for dinner time and the place was empty so I was a little skeptical to begin with. The clerk who came up to the register to take my order looked as though he had just done some crystal meth in the back which isn't unusual for small Vegas restaurants. I decided to order the $9 carne asada burrito with french fries to go . I thought ok any $9 burrito must be fantastic and boy was I wrong. When I got home and open this beast up I could see the grease pouring out of the tortilla. When I bit into the burrito the slices of avocados were raw and harder than the onions and I had to spit them out. The carne asada was chewy and overcooked without any authentic flavor. I didn't even finish half the burrito . I love authentic Mexican food but this place is a dump and lacks any concerns about quality, my advice is stay away. I feel the gut churning already. Blahhhh","so i saw the martinez taco bar in the middle of a nice little shopping center and i thought why not let's give it a try, i enjoy new things. it was rush hour for dinner time and the place was empty so i was a little skeptical to begin with. the clerk who came up to the register to take my order looked as though he had just done some crystal meth in the back which isn't unusual for small vegas restaurants. i decided to order the 9 carne asada burrito with french fries to go . i thought ok any 9 burrito must be fantastic and boy was i wrong. when i got home and open this beast up i could see the grease pouring out of the tortilla. when i bit into the burrito the slices of avocados were raw and harder than the onions and i had to spit them out. the carne asada was chewy and overcooked without any authentic flavor. i didn't even finish half the burrito . i love authentic mexican food but this place is a dump and lacks any concerns about quality, my advice is stay away. i feel the gut churning already. blahhhh",203,"joy, disappointment, realization","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'so i saw the martinez taco bar in the middle of a nice little shopping center and i thought why not let's give it a try, i enjoy new things. it was rush hour for dinner time and the place was empty so i was a little skeptical to begin with. the clerk who came up to the register to take my order looked as though he had just done some crystal meth in the back which isn't unusual for small vegas restaurants. i decided to order the 9 carne asada burrito with french fries to go . i thought ok any 9 burrito must be fantastic and boy was i wrong. when i got home and open this beast up i could see the grease pouring out of the tortilla. when i bit into the burrito the slices of avocados were raw and harder than the onions and i had to spit them out. the carne asada was chewy and overcooked without any authentic flavor. i didn't even finish half the burrito . i love authentic mexican food but this place is a dump and lacks any concerns about quality, my advice is stay away. i feel the gut churning already. blahhhh' The customer feels joy, disappointment, realization.

1,Bad experience and service.  I made a reservation here that I needed to cancel.  I cancelled it more than 5 months before I was supposed to stay and they charged my credit card saying I was a no show.  I emailed the hotel 3 times and got no response at all.  I called and talked to someone who said they have no record of me canceling.  When I asked to talk to a manager the girl on the phone said the manager Cassie would call me back.  Never got a call.  I called their corporate office to try and resolve this but I think I will have to end up disputing the charge on my credit card.

1,TL:DR - Food Poisoning\n\nSo on a recent business trip to Las Vegas I visited this restaurant twice. First time was on a Thursday night and the restaurant was extremely slow.  Only 3 tables in use in the restaurant.  It took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us.  When I asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... About the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. Still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. The pizza was amazing. The best pizza and worst service I have ever had. \n\nI went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. I explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better.  The next morning I woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. Flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  I am 100% sure of the source of the food poisoning as I only ate one thing on that day... Grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. The salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. I suggest avoiding this spot at all costs.,tl dr food poisoning n nso on a recent business trip to las vegas i visited this restaurant twice. first time was on a thursday night and the restaurant was extremely slow. only 3 tables in use in the restaurant. it took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us. when i asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... about the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. the pizza was amazing. the best pizza and worst service i have ever had. n ni went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. i explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better. the next morning i woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences i have ever had. i am 100 sure of the source of the food poisoning as i only ate one thing on that day... grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. the salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. i suggest avoiding this spot at all costs.,255,"neutral, disappointment, remorse","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'tl dr food poisoning n nso on a recent business trip to las vegas i visited this restaurant twice. first time was on a thursday night and the restaurant was extremely slow. only 3 tables in use in the restaurant. it took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us. when i asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... about the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. the pizza was amazing. the best pizza and worst service i have ever had. n ni went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. i explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better. the next morning i woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences i have ever had. i am 100 sure of the source of the food poisoning as i only ate one thing on that day... grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. the salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. i suggest avoiding this spot at all costs.'

To improve the customer's experience, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Speed up service: The customer mentions that the restaurant was extremely slow during their first visit, which led to a long wait for their food. To address this, we can ensure that staff are adequately trained and prepared to handle busy periods, and that tables are turned over more efficiently.
2. Improve communication: The customer felt ignored during their first visit, as they had to ask about their order and didn't see their waiter until the end of the meal. To improve communication, we can train staff to check on tables more frequently, and to be more proactive in addressing customer needs."

Mind you, we told them when scheduling the appointment that we were on a time crunch so we would book if they could guarantee that there would be 4 technicians so we could all get our pedis/manis done at the same time. They had said it would not be a problem. We waited for about 30 minutes until the owner came over and said we could get started soaking at the mani station for one girl. The technicians then informed her that we couldn't because the 2 girls they had taken before us were getting manis now too.

1,"I'm trying really hard not to be harsh. Honest. But this place has so many negatives and so few positives.\nMany of the reviews here mention the noise. They just don't give enough bad credit to the soundproofing.  This place is horrid for sleeping.  I stayed here Memorial weekend. The room was clean but certainly not elaborately decorated. Needed more towels. Bathroom so-so. Nothing about the room or property decor stated \""upscale\"" or \""resort\"".\nPool needs more lounge chairs, they were all hoarded and taken very early in the day. Misters would be a small but welcome addition to the Oasis bar by the pool. The Oasis bar was frequently understaffed. The poor person stuck there, \""Jaimie\"" was very pleasant but overwhelmed by the work load.  The concierge in the lobby was flat rude to several folks on situations I eavesdropped on. Front desk on check in was nothing special.\nBack to the noise....Walking down the hallway rooms 160's, 170's, etc., my friends and i could and did stop and listen to any number of conversations thru the closed doors. Mind you this was standing in mid-hall, not up against door. Amazed at how poor the soundproofing. At night the place was a crashbox of noise. Simply unacceptable on any level. And certainly poor for a Resort/Spa property.\nMy comments to the front desk regarding noise were treated as, \"" Ho-Hum.

1,"A while ago I had a bad experience w/ Pita Jungle at Arrowhead and after that experience I decided to lay off of Pita Jungle for a while until I discovered the downtown location. I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all.

1,"Bad Attitude - Well, that about sums it up. I moved out to the north valley in July of last year and thus far have spent $1900 at this shop. On two occasions I have had to deal with attitude from one of the bike mechanics there - big guy with the beard. I took my road bike in today to ask a question and the condescending mechanic only made fun of how old my bike is - yep, it's a vintage 2003 model. Not the best bike in the world but it has been a great ride for 11 years.  He also felt compelled to tell me \""you really need a new bike but don't worry it won't make you any faster\"". Here's the kicker, I did a race last weekend and decided I was going to upgrade before my next one in September. Sorry Bicycle Vibe, I'll be taking the $4K I have for my new purchase elsewhere. \n\nWhy do people have to talk down to others? Did that really make him feel better? Not only did he have a chance to make a great sell and win a customer, he had a chance to be nice to another human being. Does it really matter how old your bike is? It would be so cool to have a nice bike shop here up north, without the attitude.","bad attitude well, that about sums it up. i moved out to the north valley in july of last year and thus far have spent 1900 at this shop. on two occasions i have had to deal with attitude from one of the bike mechanics there big guy with the beard. i took my road bike in today to ask a question and the condescending mechanic only made fun of how old my bike is yep, it's a vintage 2003 model. not the best bike in the world but it has been a great ride for 11 years. he also felt compelled to tell me you really need a new bike but don't worry it won't make you any faster . here's the kicker, i did a race last weekend and decided i was going to upgrade before my next one in september. sorry bicycle vibe, i'll be taking the 4k i have for my new purchase elsewhere. n nwhy do people have to talk down to others? did that really make him feel better? not only did he have a chance to make a great sell and win a customer, he had a chance to be nice to another human being. does it really matter how old your bike is? it would be so cool to have a nice bike shop here up north, without the attitude.",228,"amusement, admiration, approval","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'bad attitude well, that about sums it up. i moved out to the north valley in july of last year and thus far have spent 1900 at this shop. on two occasions i have had to deal with attitude from one of the bike mechanics there big guy with the beard. i took my road bike in today to ask a question and the condescending mechanic only made fun of how old my bike is yep, it's a vintage 2003 model. not the best bike in the world but it has been a great ride for 11 years. he also felt compelled to tell me you really need a new bike but don't worry it won't make you any faster . here's the kicker, i did a race last weekend and decided i was going to upgrade before my next one in september. sorry bicycle vibe, i'll be taking the 4k i have for my new purchase elsewhere. n nwhy do people have to talk down to others? did that really make him feel better? not only did he have a chance to make a great sell and win a customer, he had a chance to be nice to another human being. does it really matter how old your bike is? it would be so cool to have a nice bike shop here up north, without the attitude.'

1,"We were looking forward to a yummy lunch, and we were more than disappointed. The food was nearly inedible and the waiter never inquired as to our satisfaction. The sandwich was ten dollars and there was almost no lamb to be found in the wrap. When the bill came, there was an extra charge for the fries that the waiter told us came with it!  The owner came over and kept telling us that the menu showed the side was not included.

It was surprising, since I don't remember taking Margarita mix and ice, putting it in a blender and pouring it in a glass could take so long!!!

1,"A mile or so long trail along the Mon that goes from no place to nowhere via nothing.

1,"This review is for service only as I did not see any flower arrangements.\n\nI was looking for a local florist to help with my wedding flowers. Instead of buying the flowers from an online wholesale site, I preferred to buy from a local florist - however, I wanted to do the centerpieces and bouquets myself.  I went to Gloria's (and I believe I spoke with Gloria herself) and she was very, very rude to me. She did not like that I wanted to do the arrangements myself - which is fine if she said no, she wouldn't order flowers for me. However, she said she would order flowers for me but she just gave me attitude about it in the process. She, then, proceeded to ask me what kind of flowers I wanted.

1,"I visited this shop a few months ago. Awesome clothes. I had only looked at clothes on their website and they have a much broader selection in the shop. As I was shopping, the snotty store manager seemed very annoyed that people wanted to try on their clothes before making purchases. I've worked retail as well and I get it's stressful when it's busy but it's just apart of the job. Probably wouldn't have a job if it weren't busy. She continued to be rude to me, my friends and the other patrons in the shop. When we got to the register, the girl wanted to make sure we found everything we were looking for, politely we said yes, and the line behind us was growing. When a second girl tried to open the other register, the store manager humiliated her by rudely telling her not to do this and she needed to count stock. And the stock was just tank tops on a table that there were plenty of. It surprised me that she would speak to the staff so harshly, especially when she was trying to get the patrons to make purchases. I hope she's decided that this is not the job for her and has parted. She was terrible.","i visited this shop a few months ago. awesome clothes. i had only looked at clothes on their website and they have a much broader selection in the shop. as i was shopping, the snotty store manager seemed very annoyed that people wanted to try on their clothes before making purchases. i've worked retail as well and i get it's stressful when it's busy but it's just apart of the job. probably wouldn't have a job if it weren't busy. she continued to be rude to me, my friends and the other patrons in the shop. when we got to the register, the girl wanted to make sure we found everything we were looking for, politely we said yes, and the line behind us was growing. when a second girl tried to open the other register, the store manager humiliated her by rudely telling her not to do this and she needed to count stock. and the stock was just tank tops on a table that there were plenty of. it surprised me that she would speak to the staff so harshly, especially when she was trying to get the patrons to make purchases. i hope she's decided that this is not the job for her and has parted. she was terrible.",212,"annoyance, admiration, disappointment","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'i visited this shop a few months ago. awesome clothes. i had only looked at clothes on their website and they have a much broader selection in the shop. as i was shopping, the snotty store manager seemed very annoyed that people wanted to try on their clothes before making purchases. i've worked retail as well and i get it's stressful when it's busy but it's just apart of the job. probably wouldn't have a job if it weren't busy. she continued to be rude to me, my friends and the other patrons in the shop. when we got to the register, the girl wanted to make sure we found everything we were looking for, politely we said yes, and the line behind us was growing. when a second girl tried to open the other register, the store manager humiliated her by rudely telling her not to do this and she needed to count stock. and the stock was just tank tops on a table that there were plenty of. it surprised me that she would speak to the staff so harshly, especially when she was trying to get the patrons to make purchases. i hope she's decided that this is not the job for her and has parted. she was terrible.'

3. Clarify the terms of promotions and deals clearly to avoid misunderstandings. If the offer had special fine print or terms, it should have been communicated to the customer.

4. Offer an apology and compensation for the poor experience."

1,"Just as an update, I ended up having to TOW my car away from Arizona Dyno Chip, and I took it to Gene's Auto Worx (the highest rated auto shop in the area on Yelp). Gene tackled the issues with my car, and called me back a day later to say that my car wasn't running because the Mass Air Flow sensor wasn't plugged in.

The customer feels disapproval, neutral, disappointment. Concisely, how can we best improve our services for this customer's experience?  To improve the customer's experience, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Skill Development: Improve the skills of our staff, particularly those involved in eyebrow waxing, to ensure a high-quality service. This could involve additional training or workshops.

2. Upselling: While it's important to offer additional services, we should ensure that it doesn't come across as pushy or excessive. We can review our sales approach to make it more customer-centric, focusing on providing recommendations based on the customer's needs rather than trying to sell as many products as possible."

1,"What a disaster.  I don't get the love of this place at all.  I'll agree with Patrick L on this one: William-Sonoma with a hot case.  That's all this is.  Where do I begin?\n\nFirst - the layout.  This design might be nice when one or two people is in the store but on a Saturday afternoon, this place had 30 people in it and was insane.  The layout does not help.  Not only are there three sets of lines that merge into each other creating all sorts of pile-ups but there is no where to go that you aren't in the way.  Racks of food act as line partitions more than they act as display cases.  It is really a nightmare.\n\nSecond - quality for the price.  It is a ton of high-end stuff and that's okay.  I have no issue with high end products but ... where the hell do you get off charging $5 more than some place like Delicious Dishes?  I can get the same products at a LOCALLY OWNED store for significantly less.  There is nothing special about what you stock.  You don't make these cheeses yourself.  These aren't your livestock being slaughtered.  You get this stuff from the same supplier that AJs, Trader Joes, and Petit Fromage do yet you charge like you're the only game in town.\n\nFinally - You call that a deli counter?

1,"I had a lower blepharoplasty (eye lift) by Dr. Nachbar in September 2003. This procedure left me needing reconstructive surgery costing additional thousands of dollars. My eyes will always have Dr. Nachbar's mark on them. Some of the damage is not fixable.\n\nThe results of my surgery left both eyes with incisions that were placed  low and not in a natural laugh line. To make things worse, the left eye incision curved down from the corner of the eye, extended out to about 3/4 of an inch and ended with a divit. This divit was created when the stitches were painfully pulled out. The incision scarring healed horribly and widened out leaving me with an indentation and redness to this day. The left eye was also left with a pucker from improper draping of the skin. A  piece of fat was left behind under the right eye which gave me the appearance of a big bump under that eye. Both eyes were hollowed out and rounded out leaving me with a completely different eye shape. My eyes had continual pressure, pain, irritation, and itching for 3 years after the procedure.\n\nI communicated my concerns to a Sharon Brown on staff by e-mail and phone. She was completely unhelpful. I requested my money back and never received it.\n\nI am not a person who easily dispenses bad reviews. If I could give zero stars I would. I truly regret every day that I chose Dr. Nachbar as my surgeon. I hope this review helps you in your choice.","i had a lower blepharoplasty eye lift by dr. nachbar in september 2003. this procedure left me needing reconstructive surgery costing additional thousands of dollars. my eyes will always have dr. nachbar's mark on them. some of the damage is not fixable. n nthe results of my surgery left both eyes with incisions that were placed low and not in a natural laugh line. to make things worse, the left eye incision curved down from the corner of the eye, extended out to about 3 4 of an inch and ended with a divit. this divit was created when the stitches were painfully pulled out. the incision scarring healed horribly and widened out leaving me with an indentation and redness to this day. the left eye was also left with a pucker from improper draping of the skin. a piece of fat was left behind under the right eye which gave me the appearance of a big bump under that eye. both eyes were hollowed out and rounded out leaving me with a completely different eye shape. my eyes had continual pressure, pain, irritation, and itching for 3 years after the procedure. n ni communicated my concerns to a sharon brown on staff by e mail and phone. she was completely unhelpful. i requested my money back and never received it. n ni am not a person who easily dispenses bad reviews. if i could give zero stars i would. i truly regret every day that i chose dr. nachbar as my surgeon. i hope this review helps you in your choice.",262,"neutral, disappointment, sadness","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'i had a lower blepharoplasty eye lift by dr. nachbar in september 2003. this procedure left me needing reconstructive surgery costing additional thousands of dollars. my eyes will always have dr. nachbar's mark on them. some of the damage is not fixable. n nthe results of my surgery left both eyes with incisions that were placed low and not in a natural laugh line. to make things worse, the left eye incision curved down from the corner of the eye, extended out to about 3 4 of an inch and ended with a divit. this divit was created when the stitches were painfully pulled out. the incision scarring healed horribly and widened out leaving me with an indentation and redness to this day. the left eye was also left with a pucker from improper draping of the skin. a piece of fat was left behind under the right eye which gave me the appearance of a big bump under that eye. both eyes were hollowed out and rounded out leaving me with a completely different eye shape. my eyes had continual pressure, pain, irritation, and itching for 3 years after the procedure. n ni communicated my concerns to a sharon brown on staff by e mail and phone. she was completely unhelpful. i requested my money back and never received it. n ni am not a person who easily dispenses bad reviews. if i could give zero stars i would. i truly regret every day that i chose dr. nachbar as my surgeon. i hope this review helps you in your choice.'

1,"I've always enjoyed taking my family to Bill Johnson's, but on our recent visit (2/29/12) the quality of the food, the portion sizes, and their new prices have took a turn for the worse.\n\nThe bbq pork ribs were tough as leather, the fries were very greasy and portion controlled to the max, the mac and cheese seemed like they just poured liquid cheese on top of the boiled macaroni, and to make it worse, the prices on the menu have skyrocketed.  I feel that if their going to charge more for their menu items, the quality of the food and portion sizes need to be changed as well.  I was very disappointed with the amount of money we spent for the crappy food we ate.  \n\nFurthermore, I expressed my concerns with the waitress, but she didn't seem very interested at all.  With that said, I will NEVER return to Bill Johnson's because of the BIG let down.

1,"I rarely ever have a good experience at a Best Buy. I was there the other day and I wanted the Fitbit in the light blue color. This is exactly as it is presented on their website.

When I asked why we couldn't be seated at the booth that had been sitting open for several minutes, I was told that they wouldn't seat us there because we could only have a two top.

1,"Notes: 1 visit, dinner\nOverall: Salty. (Probably even more salty than Olive Garden, which is quite a feat.)\n\nFree bread - Best part of the meal!  Soooo good.  It's some sort of dark brown bread that's super soft and has a light honey flavor to it.  I should have just eaten three baskets of that and saved us some cash.\n\nBaby back ribs - Came with virtually no sauce.  Dry and salty were the only two words that could possibly describe this horrible dish.  The fries that came with it were soft and mushy.  Ewww.\n\nCeasar salad - Salty.

To improve the customer's experience at LVAC, we could consider the following steps:

1. Limit membership sales to maintain a manageable capacity in the gym. This would help reduce overcrowding, ensure easier access to equipment, and reduce waiting times for classes.

2. Increase the frequency and thoroughness of cleaning to maintain a clean and hygienic environment. This could help address the customer's concerns about the gym's cleanliness.

3. Invest in additional equipment for classes to accommodate more participants and prevent overcrowding. This would help improve the customer's experience in classes, such as spin class, where space is limited."

   - Following up: If there are delays, have a system in place to check on orders and keep customers informed."

1,"This place is def over-rated and way to expensive for Thai food. The claim is that it's the best Thai food in the country and that's not the case . We ordered the short rib panang, Isaan sausage, soft crab noodles, house fried rice and chicken salad. Although the food had a nice kick to it the fried rice was way too sweet the chicken salad was a plain stir fried chicken dish. I was expecting this place to blow my mind away but it was a major disappointment. $80 for 5 dishes is ridiculous.","this place is def over rated and way to expensive for thai food. the claim is that it's the best thai food in the country and that's not the case . we ordered the short rib panang, isaan sausage, soft crab noodles, house fried rice and chicken salad. although the food had a nice kick to it the fried rice was way too sweet the chicken salad was a plain stir fried chicken dish. i was expecting this place to blow my mind away but it was a major disappointment. 80 for 5 dishes is ridiculous.",96,"disappointment, annoyance, disapproval","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'this place is def over rated and way to expensive for thai food. the claim is that it's the best thai food in the country and that's not the case . we ordered the short rib panang, isaan sausage, soft crab noodles, house fried rice and chicken salad. although the food had a nice kick to it the fried rice was way too sweet the chicken salad was a plain stir fried chicken dish. i was expecting this place to blow my mind away but it was a major disappointment. 80 for 5 dishes is ridiculous.'

1,"I have been shopping at Whole Foods since it opened approx 4 years ago - today was my final straw.  Over the last few months I have felt like the quality of fruits and vegtables were not up to standard particularly for the price they charge.  Last week we purchased a seedless watermelon for $4.99 cut it in half this week to find it totally rotten.  This morning I returned the melon and was quite satisfied when they gave me a piece of paper with a refund for the cashier of $4.99, they offered to have the produce manager pick one for me, he offered to cut it in half so we didn't relive the same situation.  All was good til check-out when the cashier weighed half of the watermelon, informed me I still had a .52 credit did I want the other half of the watermelon.  I calmly asked him if I saw the story straight that I returned a WHOLE rotten watermelon and he was going to give me in return a half non-rotten watermelon.  I asked him to call his manager, which he did and he was advised he was handling the situation correct.  At that point I told them to keep the watermelon.  Upon leaving the store I stopped and spoke with another manager and she also agreed it was handled correctly.

1,"I took my friend there for Sunday brunch today, and it was one of the worst brunches I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.

1,"My family went there to watch March Madness and get quick bite to eat.  My husband raved about their beers and he said the food is ok so my daughter and I decided to give it a try.  I ordered fish and chips, my daughter ordered a burger and onion rings, my husband ordered sandwich and onion ring.  We waited long time to get our drinks and food.  When we got the food I was very disappointed.  My fish was so greasy that I had to blot out the oil on my napkin which soaked my napkin.  My fries greasy and when I picked it up it was limp and very salty.  My husband gave me his onion rings and it was same as my fries (greasy and salty).  It looks to me they just dropped the fries and onion rings for few seconds and took it out.  My daughter said her burger was worse than Mcdonalds burger.  I had to flag down our waitress as she never came by to see how our food was and told her the fries were uneatable and would like a sald instead.  I only asked for olive oil and lemon wedges and my daughter asked for ranch dressing for the burger.  The lettuce in salad was wilted.  I was only able to stomach couple bites.  When we finally got the bill she charged us for the Ranch dressing.  When I sent e-mail to Zipps the response I got was that they have the highest quality food and the prices area very reasonable.  It is customary to charge for side of Ranch and that they hope I would give them a try again.

1,"I saw Mumford and Sons here and it was the worst concert I've ever been to. They made you take off the caps of any water bottles you were taking in making it extremely inconvenient to stay hydrated on a hot summer night. You could not hear ANYTHING on the lawn.

1,"At first the experience was good. The rep at this company was very friendly and seemed to listen to our needs. After talking to them specifically about the type of dog we have (a Pitbull) and that many management companies don't accept them, we were assured that was not an issue with the property we were looking at. Even their own website said on that property listing (and others) there were no breed restrictions. However after turning in our non refundable app fee, they stated that due to the breed of our dog we were not able to obtain the house...They refused to refund the app fee (due to it not being refundable) even though they were in the wrong here...they told us before we applied that the dog was no issue..Also not only did they refuse to refund the app fee they didn't even offer to use the files or app fee we paid towards another property application. The manager there tried to tell my roommate that he sits next to his rep and he knows he never said anything like this...ya we wouldn't just make this up also the manager leaves by 5 i think if i remember correctly. Most of the calls we had with the rep were after 6pm. Be very cautious in using this company. I personally don't recommend them due to my experience with them.","at first the experience was good. the rep at this company was very friendly and seemed to listen to our needs. after talking to them specifically about the type of dog we have a pitbull and that many management companies don't accept them, we were assured that was not an issue with the property we were looking at. even their own website said on that property listing and others there were no breed restrictions. however after turning in our non refundable app fee, they stated that due to the breed of our dog we were not able to obtain the house...they refused to refund the app fee due to it not being refundable even though they were in the wrong here...they told us before we applied that the dog was no issue..also not only did they refuse to refund the app fee they didn't even offer to use the files or app fee we paid towards another property application. the manager there tried to tell my roommate that he sits next to his rep and he knows he never said anything like this...ya we wouldn't just make this up also the manager leaves by 5 i think if i remember correctly. most of the calls we had with the rep were after 6pm. be very cautious in using this company. i personally don't recommend them due to my experience with them.",231,"neutral, disapproval, disappointment","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'at first the experience was good. the rep at this company was very friendly and seemed to listen to our needs. after talking to them specifically about the type of dog we have a pitbull and that many management companies don't accept them, we were assured that was not an issue with the property we were looking at. even their own website said on that property listing and others there were no breed restrictions. however after turning in our non refundable app fee, they stated that due to the breed of our dog we were not able to obtain the house...they refused to refund the app fee due to it not being refundable even though they were in the wrong here...they told us before we applied that the dog was no issue..also not only did they refuse to refund the app fee they didn't even offer to use the files or app fee we paid towards another property application. the manager there tried to tell my roommate that he sits next to his rep and he knows he never said anything like this...ya we wouldn't just make this up also the manager leaves by 5 i think if i remember correctly. most of the calls we had with the rep were after 6pm. be very cautious in using this company. i personally don't recommend them due to my experience with them.'

1,"Horrible Service! We tried tonight to use a coupon we received in the mail, but after we were seated in the dining room,  no one ever showed up to offer beverages or acknowledge our presence in anyway.  Waiters would repeatedly walk right by our booth without even looking at us, let alone stopping (they were not busy and there were quite a few empty tables). Finally after 15 minutes of being totally ignored we gave up and walked out. I wish I could give negative stars, this place is really abysmal. I will never return and have tossed the coupons in the trash.","horrible service! we tried tonight to use a coupon we received in the mail, but after we were seated in the dining room, no one ever showed up to offer beverages or acknowledge our presence in anyway. waiters would repeatedly walk right by our booth without even looking at us, let alone stopping they were not busy and there were quite a few empty tables . finally after 15 minutes of being totally ignored we gave up and walked out. i wish i could give negative stars, this place is really abysmal. i will never return and have tossed the coupons in the trash.",104,"annoyance, disappointment, disgust","[INST] A customer left us a 1-star review: 'horrible service! we tried tonight to use a coupon we received in the mail, but after we were seated in the dining room, no one ever showed up to offer beverages or acknowledge our presence in anyway. waiters would repeatedly walk right by our booth without even looking at us, let alone stopping they were not busy and there were quite a few empty tables . finally after 15 minutes of being totally ignored we gave up and walked out. i wish i could give negative stars, this place is really abysmal. i will never return and have tossed the coupons in the trash.'

There are only a handful of employees which equals a long wait for expensive mediocre food.  The first time I came here was on a Sunday morning so I chalked up the wait and the mediocre food to the fact it was Sunday morning. Today I arrived at 12:00 and waited for 20 minutes to be sat.

I will not be returning and will stick to blueberry hill when  I'm craving breakfast food.

3,"This place was surprisingly good, considering it's at a food court. After a long night of partying, I really wanted some hangover food.... and I found it! \n\nAt first glance, I thought this place was your typical fast-food chinese place, but when I looked at the menu, I saw that they serve udon - yumm! I ordered the tempura udon and my boyfriend had the seafood soup. The broth was super hot and reallyyyy soothing.

3,"This place came highly recommended from a co-worker but we ended up being disappointed. We showed up at 6:45 and they were already cleaning the grill for the night.. not sure when they close, but we probably should have taken it as a sign and kept walking. \n\nBecause it was \""late\"" we could only get sandwiches.. no fries, etc. Luckily you get to eat in a gas station, sooo you do have a great selection of chips.. whoo. The steaks were just OK. At $6.95 for a small, they are a tad pricey and honestly I think capriottis makes a better steak.

3,"I had been to the Breakfast Joynt once several years ago.

3,"This is an updated review with my experience in the Tower Deluxe Room in the West Wing Tower. It's a bit more affordable then my previous stay.

3,"when this place first opened it was really good, back then I would have given it 5 stars. Now it is just ok. My dad likes to go there, that is why we went. \nWe started with the grilled artichoke. Usually this is pretty good. Not so much this time. Maybe artichokes are out of season?. It was hard and not very flavorful.

3,"It's a good thing that Kabuki has a fun, relaxed atmosphere, because the food is nothing to shout about and the service is a weird combination of hectic yet slow.\n\nTo be fair, Japanese food in Arizona is a dicey proposition at best, especially after years in Seattle have spoiled me forever for good Asian food. And at least the layout and feel of Kabuki is open and welcoming, allowing for both big groups and a small, more intimate setting.

3,"For some reason, Amelie's is like a legend in Charlotte. Frankly, I don't know why - probably because it's one of the non-fast-food places that's open 24 hours.

3,"My visits here are few and far between, to be honest. But on all those occasions when I have come here, I always go inside the shop because there is always a line at the drive thru and I'm not so lazy on those times that I do visit this coffee shop.

3,"We went here after amateur night at the Comedy Spot (it's literally a block away). It was around midnight on a Saturday. Our cocktail server was extremely efficient and attentive; it was top-notch service, especially for a busy weekend night. The drinks were a little weak, but they were on the larger side and not too expensive. One of the people in our group complained that his double Patron shots were really small and he was right. For $18 or so a pop, those shots should have been more than generous singles. \n\nI loved the layout of the place, the variety of seating (high tables to stand around, high bars with stools, lower tables with chairs), and the clean bathrooms. The biggest disappointment of our short time there was not getting to sing karaoke, which was going at full blast when we arrived. My husband and I each put a song in as soon as we arrived, but after 45 minutes (when everyone in our group was tired and waiting to go home), we still hadn't gotten called. I don't like when KJs don't go out of their way to welcome new singers and to insert them into the existing rotation, especially since we heard the same people sing two times in the time we were waiting to sing once. On the upside, the song list was good, the singers were above-average, and I liked the little space they had for singers to stand (eat your heart out, Apollo's!). \n\nSince we live pretty far from here, I probably won't be back. I'd rather spend my karaoke budget at Kobalt or Apollos.

To improve the customer's experience, consider the following suggestions:

1. Address the issue of small drink portions, particularly for premium spirits like Patron. Ensure that the served portions meet customer expectations for the price.

2. Improve karaoke management to accommodate new singers more efficiently. Consider implementing a system that prioritizes new singers or rotates them more frequently into the existing rotation.

3. If possible, provide clearer communication about the karaoke system, such as estimated wait times or a system for requesting songs.

4. Consider offering a loyalty program or discounts for repeat customers to encourage return visits."

I enjoyed the hummus, baba ganoush, falafel and tabbouleh. Unfortunately, the chicken gyro left a lot to be desired. The chicken looked and tasted as if it had been baked a day or two ahead of our visit. Tough, colorless and flavorless. And the pitas weren't homemade or fresh.

3,"My daughter and i came for lunch today. We parked in the back and walked through the open dining and inside dining on our way to the hostess station. We noticed five or six open tables on our way in. We were surprised to hear from the hostess that there was a 10-15 minute wait to be seated. \n\n(What? Can i just go sit down at one of the six open tables?) \n\nWe waited and were seated within the promised window. We ordered calimari fries to start, with my daughter ordering fish and chips, and salmon tacos for myself.\n\nThe calimari fries came out hot, crispy, and were very tasty. We finished them off quickly. Both sauces were great.\n\nNext delivered, were my daughters fish and chips, and some shrimp and chips that looked yummy, but were not what i ordered. The waiter promised a quick fix. I noticed the patrons at a neighboring table having bewildered looks, and no food on their table, despite being seated before us.\n\nThe salmon tacos arrived within five minutes. The fish was near perfectly cooked, the tortillas tender but not frail, overall very delicious. My daughters fish and chips were tasty, good crunch on the outside with tasty fish inside. Chips were reasonable, but not inspiring. The beans and rice that came with my meal were sufficient.\n\nWaitstaff were nice enough, but maybe a little inexperienced, and slow at times.

3,"Well, with all the hype I had to go to Hakkasan. Unless you are down to drop a couple grand, this is not gonna be such a sweet experience. I went when Calvin Harris was performing. First, Harris is extremely overrated. I've been to plenty shows, and I can confidently say Calvin Harris is not even in my top 10. Second, the venue itself is classy, but it's kind of a maze and the dance floor is freaking tiny. Surprisingly, the drinks were not that expensive for Vegas. I should have listen to my pals and gone to XS. Oh, well. I needed to experience it myself. Definitely not going back, though. The lasers are badass, however. One of the best equipment I've seen.","well, with all the hype i had to go to hakkasan. unless you are down to drop a couple grand, this is not gonna be such a sweet experience. i went when calvin harris was performing. first, harris is extremely overrated. i've been to plenty shows, and i can confidently say calvin harris is not even in my top 10. second, the venue itself is classy, but it's kind of a maze and the dance floor is freaking tiny. surprisingly, the drinks were not that expensive for vegas. i should have listen to my pals and gone to xs. oh, well. i needed to experience it myself. definitely not going back, though. the lasers are badass, however. one of the best equipment i've seen.",124,"surprise, disappointment, disapproval","[INST] A customer left us a 3-star review: 'well, with all the hype i had to go to hakkasan. unless you are down to drop a couple grand, this is not gonna be such a sweet experience. i went when calvin harris was performing. first, harris is extremely overrated. i've been to plenty shows, and i can confidently say calvin harris is not even in my top 10. second, the venue itself is classy, but it's kind of a maze and the dance floor is freaking tiny. surprisingly, the drinks were not that expensive for vegas. i should have listen to my pals and gone to xs. oh, well. i needed to experience it myself. definitely not going back, though. the lasers are badass, however. one of the best equipment i've seen.'

The customer feels surprise, disappointment, disapproval. Concisely, how can we best improve our services for this customer's experience?  To improve the customer's experience at Hakkasan, we could consider the following:

1. Address the customer's expectations: Clearly communicate the price range and the type of experience offered at Hakkasan, especially when a high-profile artist like Calvin Harris is performing. This could help manage customer expectations and reduce the feeling of being overcharged.

2. Improve the layout of the venue: Make the venue less confusing and easier to navigate, especially the dance floor area. A larger dance floor could provide a better experience for customers who are there to enjoy the music and dancing."
3,"Something hilarious about this Azteca outpost being attached to a slightly retro Day's Inn. Love the weird, ad hoc additions to the architecture - thatched roof beverage station awkwardly built into a corner, odd wood and glass entry hallway made more cramped by the quarter-for-a-bronco-ride thingy. \n\nEverything here is slightly more compressed than the Matthews location - booths narrower, tables closer. Service more harried because they do a LOT more business here - even at a slightly off time for dinner, the place was hoppin'. \n\nI could be imagining things, but I feel like prices were 50 cents higher than the other location, hmm. Servings were a tad smaller, for sure, but you don't need to finish that arm-sized burrito, anyway. \n\nOnto the food: I got the Macho Burrito, he got the usual (fajitas). Now, I've had the Macho at Don Pedro, the other Azteca location, and here - it's a nopales burrito, so it's full of pickled cactus. This was by far the best version I'd had - because the jalapenos were fresh, so it wasn't almost too salty to eat (which, admittedly, has never stopped me from ordering it before). Goooood. A mild, almost mozzarella queso was used instead of the monterey jack I'm used to, continuing the low-sodium thing (except for the nopales). Awesome.\n\nFajitas were, well, Azteca Fajitas - smothered in sweet teriyaki-style flavors. Weird.\n\nI'd come back if I were in the nabe and had a serious burrito craving, but I'd probably be thinking about the taco trucks and taquerias down the street the whole time.","something hilarious about this azteca outpost being attached to a slightly retro day's inn. love the weird, ad hoc additions to the architecture thatched roof beverage station awkwardly built into a corner, odd wood and glass entry hallway made more cramped by the quarter for a bronco ride thingy. n neverything here is slightly more compressed than the matthews location booths narrower, tables closer. service more harried because they do a lot more business here even at a slightly off time for dinner, the place was hoppin'. n ni could be imagining things, but i feel like prices were 50 cents higher than the other location, hmm. servings were a tad smaller, for sure, but you don't need to finish that arm sized burrito, anyway. n nonto the food i got the macho burrito, he got the usual fajitas . now, i've had the macho at don pedro, the other azteca location, and here it's a nopales burrito, so it's full of pickled cactus. this was by far the best version i'd had because the jalapenos were fresh, so it wasn't almost too salty to eat which, admittedly, has never stopped me from ordering it before . goooood. a mild, almost mozzarella queso was used instead of the monterey jack i'm used to, continuing the low sodium thing except for the nopales . awesome. n nfajitas were, well, azteca fajitas smothered in sweet teriyaki style flavors. weird. n ni'd come back if i were in the nabe and had a serious burrito craving, but i'd probably be thinking about the taco trucks and taquerias down the street the whole time.",270,"amusement, love, neutral","[INST] A customer left us a 3-star review: 'something hilarious about this azteca outpost being attached to a slightly retro day's inn. love the weird, ad hoc additions to the architecture thatched roof beverage station awkwardly built into a corner, odd wood and glass entry hallway made more cramped by the quarter for a bronco ride thingy. n neverything here is slightly more compressed than the matthews location booths narrower, tables closer. service more harried because they do a lot more business here even at a slightly off time for dinner, the place was hoppin'. n ni could be imagining things, but i feel like prices were 50 cents higher than the other location, hmm. servings were a tad smaller, for sure, but you don't need to finish that arm sized burrito, anyway. n nonto the food i got the macho burrito, he got the usual fajitas . now, i've had the macho at don pedro, the other azteca location, and here it's a nopales burrito, so it's full of pickled cactus. this was by far the best version i'd had because the jalapenos were fresh, so it wasn't almost too salty to eat which, admittedly, has never stopped me from ordering it before . goooood. a mild, almost mozzarella queso was used instead of the monterey jack i'm used to, continuing the low sodium thing except for the nopales . awesome. n nfajitas were, well, azteca fajitas smothered in sweet teriyaki style flavors. weird. n ni'd come back if i were in the nabe and had a serious burrito craving, but i'd probably be thinking about the taco trucks and taquerias down the street the whole time.'

3,"It looks like Stations Casinos brought back the Grand Cafe. I didn't have high expectations upon entering this place, since I remember the old Grand Cafe being pretty terrible.\n\nFirst thing that I noticed was that they're really trying to emphasize better service. Staff is much more friendly and accommodating this time around, which is already an improvement. I never really expected to be greeted with smiling faces and a friendly welcome when I'm in the Boulder Station. I mean, c'mon, it's the Boulder Station. The Boulder Strip doesn't exactly scream with class. \n\nThe menu did go through some minor tweaks, but it still contains the standard cafe fare, with $7.99 daily specials that come with soup or salad. They also  have some off-menu specials like a $3.99 skillet breakfast, $5.99 burger special, or $7.99 for a mountain of Rocky Road pancakes.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered some spinach & artichoke dip, served with pita bread. Wasn't too bad, seemed a little lighter than most spinach dips that I have had.\n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I ordered the potato crusted trout special, one of the Friday specials. It practically looked like a two rectangular hash browns with trout hiding inside. It wasn't too bad actually, especially for a $8 seafood dish.\n\nThey tout that their Kona coffee is freshly brewed and ground every 90-minutes, which got me interested in trying it out. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but it tasted good enough for me.\n\nAll in all, a decent experience. This is somewhere I'd go for lazy and cheap eating, when I'm not willing to make a drive anywhere to break the bank. It's decent food, but nothing to go out of the way for.

3,"My first Q'doba experience also happened to take place in Madison, WI where I would visit a good friend of mine while living in the Chicago area. This was back around '99-'00 or so, I believe, and I'd never experienced a Chipotle to compare it to. I really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when I moved to Michigan I would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. I was pretty psyched when the one on Rural opened up out here because Chipotle never sits right in my stomach (not that it necessarily stops me...but I always dread the impending doom that eating there brings). Unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the Q'doba I remembered, and it's just sorta average. I like the chicken, but the steak is blah. Queso is ok, but I've had much better. This is the one place where I actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and I like the hot as well. No salsa complaints here. I usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at Chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa (queso at the Q).","my first q'doba experience also happened to take place in madison, wi where i would visit a good friend of mine while living in the chicago area. this was back around '99 '00 or so, i believe, and i'd never experienced a chipotle to compare it to. i really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when i moved to michigan i would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. i was pretty psyched when the one on rural opened up out here because chipotle never sits right in my stomach not that it necessarily stops me...but i always dread the impending doom that eating there brings . unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the q'doba i remembered, and it's just sorta average. i like the chicken, but the steak is blah. queso is ok, but i've had much better. this is the one place where i actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and i like the hot as well. no salsa complaints here. i usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa queso at the q .",201,"joy, approval, admiration","[INST] A customer left us a 3-star review: 'my first q'doba experience also happened to take place in madison, wi where i would visit a good friend of mine while living in the chicago area. this was back around '99 '00 or so, i believe, and i'd never experienced a chipotle to compare it to. i really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when i moved to michigan i would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. i was pretty psyched when the one on rural opened up out here because chipotle never sits right in my stomach not that it necessarily stops me...but i always dread the impending doom that eating there brings . unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the q'doba i remembered, and it's just sorta average. i like the chicken, but the steak is blah. queso is ok, but i've had much better. this is the one place where i actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and i like the hot as well. no salsa complaints here. i usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa queso at the q .'

Beer doesn't taste good when it tastes like soap.\n\nAnyhoo, I had a steak salad which was not what I was expecting.  I ordered steak medium and it came well over that.  I was starving so I didn't send it back and it ended up being pretty tender regardless.  The odd part was that the salad part of my meal was probably less greens than a side salad.  And on top of that, they also put hot sauteed veggies as a side on the plate.  So I had a pile of hot zucchini and onions wilting my tiny salad.  I thought that they got my order wrong but when I got the receipt it did say \""Steak Salad\"".  It did taste pretty good overall though.  \n\nThe beer was OK.

3. Menu Diversity: Although the customer enjoys the pork gisantes and pancit, expanding the menu could provide more options for customers who may have dietary restrictions or preferences."
3,"5 Star Massage & awesome facilities, but I have two negatives that detract from my rating.\n\nFirst, the positive: the massage was top notch. We came for a couples massage and I think each of us would highly recommend the practitioners. Probably one of the best massages I've ever had.\n\nTwo negatives:\n\n1. The price for a massage was reasonable, but they did not tell us that the \""water circuit\"" was an additional charge of $35 per person until we checked out. (If you just want to attend the spa, and don't have any services it costs $55.) So be sure that you know the full price when you sign up.\n\n2. The spa facilities are very cool and the design is modern: There are lots of areas to relax and chill out in between steam room, sauna, and hot tub, etc.  But the locker room is too minimalist. The lockers are small and there aren't adequate  areas to lay your belongings while you change. The real complaint, however, is that there are no products other than shampoo and conditioner. It has been my experience that most spas provide an ample supply of products (razors, shaving cream, deodorant, etc.). So bring your own. And bring your own shoes - the robes are nice, but they don't provide shower shoes. \n\nI still recommend the experience. It is a unique and cool facility, but know what you're buying first.","5 star massage awesome facilities, but i have two negatives that detract from my rating. n nfirst, the positive the massage was top notch. we came for a couples massage and i think each of us would highly recommend the practitioners. probably one of the best massages i've ever had. n ntwo negatives n n1. the price for a massage was reasonable, but they did not tell us that the water circuit was an additional charge of 35 per person until we checked out. if you just want to attend the spa, and don't have any services it costs 55. so be sure that you know the full price when you sign up. n n2. the spa facilities are very cool and the design is modern there are lots of areas to relax and chill out in between steam room, sauna, and hot tub, etc. but the locker room is too minimalist. the lockers are small and there aren't adequate areas to lay your belongings while you change. the real complaint, however, is that there are no products other than shampoo and conditioner. it has been my experience that most spas provide an ample supply of products razors, shaving cream, deodorant, etc. . so bring your own. and bring your own shoes the robes are nice, but they don't provide shower shoes. n ni still recommend the experience. it is a unique and cool facility, but know what you're buying first.",241,"admiration, approval, neutral","[INST] A customer left us a 3-star review: '5 star massage awesome facilities, but i have two negatives that detract from my rating. n nfirst, the positive the massage was top notch. we came for a couples massage and i think each of us would highly recommend the practitioners. probably one of the best massages i've ever had. n ntwo negatives n n1. the price for a massage was reasonable, but they did not tell us that the water circuit was an additional charge of 35 per person until we checked out. if you just want to attend the spa, and don't have any services it costs 55. so be sure that you know the full price when you sign up. n n2. the spa facilities are very cool and the design is modern there are lots of areas to relax and chill out in between steam room, sauna, and hot tub, etc. but the locker room is too minimalist. the lockers are small and there aren't adequate areas to lay your belongings while you change. the real complaint, however, is that there are no products other than shampoo and conditioner. it has been my experience that most spas provide an ample supply of products razors, shaving cream, deodorant, etc. . so bring your own. and bring your own shoes the robes are nice, but they don't provide shower shoes. n ni still recommend the experience. it is a unique and cool facility, but know what you're buying first.'

You would think it would be all fancy shmancy but as soon as we walked in and saw some people chilling there in their t shirts in jeans, realized it was pretty casual.  But we didn't feel awkward being all dressed up.\n\nI thought the concept of the menu was cool.  Basically you choose from a selection of Japan/Korea, Indian, Singapore/Hong Kong and Thai cuisine.  The plates are tapas style and meant for sharing so they recommend 3 to 4 per person.  \n\nOr you may choose from two \""Bento Delight\"" selections for 48 bucks, which is basically their prix fix combos.\n\nWe didn't go with the Bento and ordered the garlic and cheese naan, mustard chicken tikka, yum ma muang, char siew pork & siew yoke, sashimi and we were both pretty stuffed.  Dishes were good except the char siew pork and siew yoke, didn't care for that one.  The sashimi was excellent.\n\nOverall, it was good but nothing wow especially for the price, 10-12 bucks per plate.  Kinda silly to pay 12 bucks for naan but at least it was good and hey it's vegas.

3,"Let me start by saying that the service is excellent! Brian, our waiter, was really attentive, had great recommendations, and enhanced our overall dining experience. The food and ambiance, however, were okay...nothing special. The steaks are gigantic so if you're going for portion size, this is the place to be. However, I felt like both our steaks were a little too charred and both had really large chunks of pepper scaterred throughout. We started with the crab cakes followed by the dry aged rib eye and the Kansas city strip, and then the root beer float and cookies for dessert. One of us got the pri-fix menu with the dry aged rib eye. I'd definitely recommend getting the pri-fix menu since you get an appetizer, a trio of sides, and a dessert. This is a special menu you have to ask for though...so they don't offer this deal upfront. The truffle mac and cheese and brussel sprouts were my favorite dishes of the evening.

3,"Buddy and I popped in here prior to a concert at the Fillmore. We were surprised at the large amount of seating, and the giant picnic tables are really awesome. Personally I was excited to see they had Ass Clown Brewery on tap because I had not tried them yet. So I got a pint of that and boy was it good! I paired it with a brat on pretzel roll.

3. Communicate crowd expectations: Clearer communication about the typical crowd at the hotel could help manage expectations."
3,"I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant.

3,"Tasty but so damn expensive.\n\nWe stayed at the Vdara and because there's not much food option at Vdara, decided to order pizzas for carry-out.  Went for the Gotham, which is sorta like a meat-lovers with a spicy kick, and the North Beach, which is a pizza with clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano.  \n\nGotham's tasty, just as expected, especially if you're a fan of pepperoni and/or salami.  The North Beach was sort of a gamble since we wanted to try something different and man, we lost.

3,"I actually went here twice this past weekend while my parents were in town. We first popped in for dinner and then again for the breakfast buffet.

Now, the same way I wouldn't complain about a bronze medal I really can't complain about the food. However, I truly can't rave about it.

The customer feels love, approval, admiration. Concisely, how can we best improve our services for this customer's experience?  To improve the customer's experience, we could consider the following steps:

1. Expand the store space: To reduce the crowding issue, consider expanding the store or reorganizing the layout to provide more room for customers to browse comfortably.

2. Staff training: Offer language training and customer service workshops to improve the staff's English language skills and overall service quality. This will help create a more welcoming and engaging environment for customers.

3. Personalized attention: Train staff to provide more personalized attention to customers, such as offering assistance with product selection based on the customer's preferences and style."

3,"It is and will always be that late night restaurant that is super fast, semi lively, and satisfying. This place has totally surpassed its name by remotely being called \""F**cking Long\"" by many. It utterly appears to me as having one of the quickest service.. almost as fast as McDonalds.\n\nSince I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed.

The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!\n\nOf course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well. \n\nGirls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers. Don't forget, if there are other groups of girls who come in who, lets say, came back from clubbing, you would immediately become one of the rejectees and may have some difficulty getting employee attention.

3,"Les filles du roi is a highly rated restaurant in books and this website. I found the service to be exemplary and the d\u00e9cor to be charming, old school style. But the food wasn't that great and neither were the main dish selections. My appetizer was made from filo dough and stuffed with honey, goat cheese and walnuts. It came with a spinach salad. This was the best part of the meal and very yummy tasting! Then I had the stuffed rabbit. It wasn't that tasty and I personally think \""Comme chez soi\""'s rabbit is 100 times better. My colleague had the traditional Quebec food platter and mentioned that most of it was tasteless too.

To improve the customer's experience at Les Filles du Roi, we could focus on enhancing the main dish offerings, particularly the rabbit dish, as it was a point of disappointment for the customer.

Additionally, we could consider offering a wider variety of main dish options to cater to diverse tastes and preferences. This could help ensure that there is something appealing for every customer.

Lastly, while the decor and service were appreciated, it's important to remember that a restaurant's success is largely based on the food."

To enhance the customer's experience and cater to their preferences, consider the following improvements:

1. Maintain a consistent crowd: While themed nights may attract a larger audience, ensuring a balanced crowd on regular days could help create a more comfortable atmosphere for all customers.

2. Monitor tab usage: Implementing a clear tab policy, such as limiting the number of drinks one person can order for others, could help prevent excessive spending and ensure a fair experience for all customers.

3. Offer more affordable drink options during non-happy hour periods: This could help make the bar more appealing to a wider range of customers and prevent feelings of spending too much."

3,"Went here for dinner last Thursday and the food was good.  I had the Ahi appetizer and salmon along with 2 beers for $50, which is very reasonably priced for Vegas.  The atmosphere was nice and i enjoyed the game while I had my dinner.  The only reason for 3 stars was the service.  It was not a very comfortable place to eat as I had to track down a menu and seek out the bartender to place the order.  Also, the bartender looked like she just lost a $1000 bet at the roulette table and wasn't very friendly.

3,"I've eaten at this HAG location twice.  Each time, the wait staff were attentive and responsive.  It's a limited menu - but portions are substantial.  The fries are above average and I rate the shakes as O.K.  It detracts from the shakes that they are served in cheap plastic cups.

3,"OK so I was REALLY REALLY looking forward to getting my Lousiana style crawfish / seafood. I've been missing my Boiling Crab in Cali. This was probably the closest I would get, since they don't have it in Chicago. I was a little disappointed by the crawfish, because the shell was super thick and hard, and there was just something a little different about the sauce. I still ate like a beast, don't get me wrong. I mean how can you not be a little messy when you eat with your hands and there's sauce everywhere...but I think I really would have enjoyed it a lot more if the crawfish was like what they give you at Boiling Crab. Maybe they're from a different region? It really makes a difference if their shells are so hard, makes it difficult to peel. And the taste of the crawfish meat was even different! Almost like it was a \""lower grade\"" of seafood meat.\n\nAnyway, we also ordered clams, crab legs, and shrimp. I really enjoyed the crab legs and clams, and the shrimp was pretty good too. We got fries to share, which was a welcomed distraction for our tongues after too much spicy/garlic-y goodness.

To improve the customer's experience, consider sourcing Louisiana-style crawfish from a different region or supplier to ensure thinner, easier-to-peel shells.

Offering a brief explanation of the origin of the crawfish and any differences in taste or texture could also help manage customer expectations. Lastly, consider offering a complimentary side or small dish to help balance the spiciness of the garlic sauce, as mentioned in the review."

To improve the customer's experience, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Crowd Management: To reduce overcrowding, consider implementing a reservation system for busy nights or limiting the number of guests during peak hours. This could help ensure that there is enough space for everyone to move comfortably.

2. Pricing: Review the cover charge policy to ensure it is fair and competitive. Offering a consistent price for both men and women could help improve the customer's perception of the venue.

3. Dance Floor Space: Consider expanding the dance floor area or creating more designated dance spaces to accommodate larger crowds."
3,Haha. Diego. Unfortunately this review may be based on the hype it got before we actually went to eat here... but it was seriously just OK for me. Im not huge on mexican food but it was better than usual for me (although thats not saying much).  The service was SLLLOOOWWW. We ordered guac and the guy came after an hour. The sangria was actually really good. I got Fish tacos which were really good... but then again after waiting for what seemed like at least 1.5 hrs for food anything in my face would have gotten devoured.

Their quesadillas are awesome, they don't get much better than that.  (And I work in a New Mexican style kitchen). I feel they should offer more Mexican beers on tap, and definitely need more tequila options.  The frozen margaritas aren't anything to brag about, however.

I give three stars due to dirty tables, poor beer selection on tap, and the usual generic tequila selection.

3,"I went here for dinner with my guy last night and I completely agree with the other reviews, the patio is fantastic. It has a great view and its surprisingly quiet and secluded while being right above Indian School road. The wine and beer selection is impressive. I really like all of the local choices. \nThe food however was underwhelming. I started with the fries which had rosemary and parmesan and a dipping sauce similar to a thousand island on the side. It was good, but not great. For our entrees we had the sausage and mushroom pizza, and the penne ragu. The pizza was tasty, it had caramelized onions three types of mushrooms and Italian sausage, the crust was just the way I like it not too crispy and not too soft, but definitely a fork and knife needed pizza. The ragu was interesting; it reminded me of everything that would be inside a shredded beef burrito but instead of a tortilla it's in a bowl with penne pasta underneath. It wasn't bad just unexpected.

3,"Food is good, nice ambience, the service is substandard. We had to wait for 15 minutes for our reserved table, even though it was empty and it took them so long to clean and set it.

We had their more expensive oysters (Kusshi from BC) last time, and didn't like them too much (too sweet and creamy). Grassy Bar, in our opinion were the best, nicely balanced, slight mineral taste, not too sweet not too salty, nice texture and aftertaste. \n\nOysters were followed by crispy frog legs in thai sauce, roasted octopus, bouillabaisse, and buttermilk cake. The food was delicious, although bouillabaisse was a little on a saltier side. The service was friendly, but inattentive. We had to constantly ask for napkins, cutlery, water, wine top up, and bread. The waiters were very apologetic every time but still inept. I've seen better service at some cheap diners. It's a pity that the management doesn't make an effort to recruit and/or train the right staff. We were there a couple of times last year, and the service was much better then.

3. Improve drink service in the slot section: Ensure that drink service is prompt and consistent in the slot area, as this is another area of dissatisfaction for the customer."

2. Ensure that the ATM is always in working order, as it may be inconvenient for customers who prefer to pay in cash.

3. Train staff to communicate policies clearly and empathetically, especially when it comes to payment methods. Explain the reasons behind any minimum spend requirements and be open to feedback and suggestions."

Additionally, we could consider offering a variety of sauce options to complement the chicken and allow customers to customize their meal to their taste preferences.

Furthermore, we could explore ways to elevate the presentation of our dishes, as visual appeal can greatly enhance the dining experience. Lastly, we could consider offering a wider selection of desserts, as the customer particularly enjoyed the cheesecake. Offering more options in this category might encourage repeat visits."

3,"I'm not a big fan of the concept of the Walmart Neighborhood Market - according to Walmart, it's supposed to \""woo shoppers with easier parking, less crowded aisles and quicker checkout.\"" I can see how that would be appealing to someone who treats Walmart SuperCenter as the place to do their primary grocery shopping. In that case, the individual would probably welcome the opportunity to skip out on the toys, electronics, home goods, and massive lines that characterize your average Super Walmart. They would probably be thrilled with the fact that this version of Walmart maintains the low prices but downsizes the space and speeds up checkout (and for that matter, has self-checkout, which larger Walmarts do not). \n\nHowever, since I shop for groceries elsewhere (my love, Fresh and Easy, or Fry's), only get food at Walmart if I'm also there shopping for other things, and see Walmart as a place to find home goods (paper products, cat food, towels) at really low prices, the Neighborhood Market doesn't really serve my needs. When I went to this location last night to check it out on the day of its grand opening, I discovered that the selection of non-food home goods is pretty small. As an example, they only had 2-3 brands of cat food. They also didn't have hard alcohol (only wine and beer), and the deli selection looked pretty slim. \n\nTo sum it up, if you frequent larger Walmarts for food, limited house goods, and the pharmacy, you will appreciate having a downsized version of the store.

3,"Everyone tells me I should have had one of their burgers. But it was morning and breakfast seemed like the way to go. Silly me. \n\nBreakfast was ok. Nothing to write home about, but it was ok. Hotcakes were kind of chewy (yeah, I'm not sure they should be chewy). My Mom used to say that pancakes should be light and fluffy. My eggs (over easy) were perfect.

Yep, but I'd have a burger next time . . . even for breakfast.\n\nService was very good. Thank you. \n\nStanding outside in the parking lot after wards saying goodbye to my dining companion, we noticed that one of their three (3) American flags was hanging upside down. Did that mean they were in distress? A little bit in distress? Two were right side up. Or did someone just put it up wrong and not notice?

3,"This review is based on a single dinner at Cafe Bellagio.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the nice opulent decor, followed by friendly greetings by the hostess and our server, Julie K.  The meal then began with a warm tasty roll and butter, followed by a good Crab Dip spread on toasted baguette slices.  But the dip could have been creamier.\n\nA crock of French Onion Soup with well-melted Gruyere Cheese was excellent, and dense Meatloaf topped by Brown Gravy and mushrooms was very good with Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans.  Unfortunately, the chef read the ticket wrong, and Diane had to send her medium burger back to receive a medium rare replacement.  Then she pronounced her Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger with Parmesan Fries as tasting very good.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall!

3,"I found Omega Gyros to be just average.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly remarkable, either.  Prices, similarly, were not particularly high nor low, but just average.  On the whole, they make serviceable food at average prices, and it is a fine option if you're in the area.  I still prefer Flaming Kabob which is about ten minutes down the street.\n\nI had a falafel pita sandwich for dinner, along with a side of curly fries.  The best thing about the sandwich was its generous size: the thing was absolutely massive and really filled me up.  The ingredients were okay.  The veggies didn't taste remarkably fresh, but they were perfectly acceptable.  The centerpiece of the sandwich, the falafel, was not the best I've ever had.  The texture of the falafel wasn't particularly great: the whole thing was fairly mushy.  There was no contrast between the fried exterior and the usually much softer interior.  The flavor profile, likewise, was not my favorite either.  The falafel tasted quite a bit like pumpkin bread due to the spice combinations they'd used.  The flavor itself isn't bad, but it doesn't belong in a falafel.\n\nThe curly fries were fine.  They were just curly fries like you can get anywhere else.\n\nOverall, just average.

2. Improve the texture of our falafel, aiming for a better contrast between the fried exterior and the softer interior.
3. Review our spice combinations in the falafel to ensure they align more closely with traditional falafel flavor profiles.
4. Consider offering a wider variety of options to cater to diverse tastes and preferences, as the customer's roommate seemed to have a more positive experience with the lamb beef gyro."

I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \""Best lunch in town!\"" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \""Yes, i think I will\"". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly.

2,"Man, this place is not a good venue for the over 21 crowd to enjoy a concert. This place has absolutely nothing special about it at all, except some good bands occasionally and a decent patio. My first experience here is when I turned 21 and saw Phunk Junkeez and others, oh wait I didnt get to see them because I got kicked out! Security here sucks, they are big dumb a-holes. I was kicked out shortly after turning 21 for supposedly giving drinks to minors and being drunk. The supposed minors were not even with me and my friends got kicked out also for drinking, which they weren't. I admit I was a lil tipsy, but the bouncers were jerkoffs and didnt believe I was 21 even though they were staring at my id. Oh well that was awhile ago and I have went back reluctantly since then. I saw atmosphere last May, we had to park a mile away over the bridge(lame) and wait in a longass line to get in. Take my shoes off??what? Am I a terrorist now? Give me a break. Anyhow, the bar's drinks are AWFUL and way expensive for the quantity and quality. The show was good though, sound isn't too bad.

2,"I came here a couple of times while staying at the Tropicana this week. Overall, it's everything you would expect from an in-resort snack bar, but I still found it to be a bit overpriced. A couple of small scoops of gelato will run you $7, and the gelato is only okay. You can actually get more for less over at the Bellagio.\n\nThe self-serve frozen yogurt is a better deal, at $0.49 an ounce, and there are some interesting flavors to try (coconut to peanut butter to cake batter).

2,"At least twice per month Republic Services skips picking up my trash. I've complained five or six times now and they always send out a truck to pick it up, but I shouldn't have to call.

2,"Coming back to Vegas, I met with some friends for brunch here. Here and there, they'd boast of this place as though it was a religious experience. However, I beg to differ.\n\nService was decent - fulfilling the bare requirements of refilling my water and taking my order. Other than that, where's the conversation? Better yet, where is the smile?\n\nOnto the food, I had ordered a breakfast concoction comprised of eggs, feta, spinach, and chicken. Pita on the side as well as potatoes, it was decent. The chicken was dried out, while the eggs were flavorless. I had a bite of my friend's breakfast burrito, which was good.

2,"I really wanted to like this place after countless friends raved about it over & over again. The first time I went with my boyfriend on a date. We had to wait over 2 hours but we were willing to because of all the positive reviews. By the time we finally got seated, we were ravenous and ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries. They weren't anything special. For dinner I got the Surf and Turf Burgushi. It took forever for it to come out and once it did, it was ice cold. I wasn't really expecting to eat cold, ground beef crumbles. At least my martini was delicious!\n\nThe second time I went was nearly a year later. Wanting to give the infamous Burgushi another try. This time I got the taste explosion. It was really quite plain and fell apart as soon as you picked it up since it's just crumbles of burger meat. Pretty disappointing. That said, the milkshakes are AMAZING. I had the No Sleep till Brooklyn which was an espresso and coffee infused alcoholic shake. It was the redeeming item of the evening.","i really wanted to like this place after countless friends raved about it over over again. the first time i went with my boyfriend on a date. we had to wait over 2 hours but we were willing to because of all the positive reviews. by the time we finally got seated, we were ravenous and ordered the parmesan truffle fries. they weren't anything special. for dinner i got the surf and turf burgushi. it took forever for it to come out and once it did, it was ice cold. i wasn't really expecting to eat cold, ground beef crumbles. at least my martini was delicious! n nthe second time i went was nearly a year later. wanting to give the infamous burgushi another try. this time i got the taste explosion. it was really quite plain and fell apart as soon as you picked it up since it's just crumbles of burger meat. pretty disappointing. that said, the milkshakes are amazing. i had the no sleep till brooklyn which was an espresso and coffee infused alcoholic shake. it was the redeeming item of the evening.",186,"desire, neutral, approval","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'i really wanted to like this place after countless friends raved about it over over again. the first time i went with my boyfriend on a date. we had to wait over 2 hours but we were willing to because of all the positive reviews. by the time we finally got seated, we were ravenous and ordered the parmesan truffle fries. they weren't anything special. for dinner i got the surf and turf burgushi. it took forever for it to come out and once it did, it was ice cold. i wasn't really expecting to eat cold, ground beef crumbles. at least my martini was delicious! n nthe second time i went was nearly a year later. wanting to give the infamous burgushi another try. this time i got the taste explosion. it was really quite plain and fell apart as soon as you picked it up since it's just crumbles of burger meat. pretty disappointing. that said, the milkshakes are amazing. i had the no sleep till brooklyn which was an espresso and coffee infused alcoholic shake. it was the redeeming item of the evening.'

Since we wanted to sit inside, we decided to go past the ordering counter to see if there were any tables there.

2,"First...know there are/were 3 locations. Not familiar with Vegas, we ended up at the M Hotel specifically to eat at the Hash House...of course it had closed 2 days prior...you'd think they'd update their website. So, we drive back 20 minutes to arrive at the one on the strip. Greeted (if you can call it that) by a young man, a host, who looked miserable to be there. Slumped over in a stool at the host stand. Not very welcoming and took our name. \n\nWe were seated after a 30 minute wait. Service was rather slow. My husband ordered the sage chicken Benedict which he said was ok.

To improve the customer's experience, we can focus on the following areas:

1. Staffing and Communication: Ensure that there is adequate staffing during busy periods, and that all staff members are aware of their roles and responsibilities. In this case, it seems that the customer was expecting assistance from Paco, but he was not present.

2. Service Quality: Improve the frequency and quality of service. The customer felt ignored after the initial interaction with the server. Regular check-ins and addressing any issues promptly can help improve the overall dining experience.

3. Food Quality and Presentation: Pay close attention to food preparation and presentation."

BUT, because it's new, I can't say that I had a great first impression.  \n\nThumbs up to the atmosphere and decor - it was refreshing to see a bar in Vegas that didn't look like a typical bar in Vegas.  I enjoyed the live music - definitely a nice touch.. took a peek at the lounge but didn't find it too inviting... \n\nAs for the food, the appetizer selection was great.. the entrees?  Not so much.

2,"I've been to OHSO once with a friend and another time with a date.  I was excited to first go there due to their large arizona beer selection on tap.

2,"We went to this Bistro based on a recommendation. It wasn't very busy when we first went in & were able to put in an order right away. My friend & I both decided on the Rosemary Chicken Panini. Considering how busy it was (not too busy), it took a pretty long time to get our food.\n\nEach sandwich was served with a small portion of greens topped with their mustard vinaigrette. I don't care much for greens but I'd say that the mustard vinaigrette was the best thing on the plate. I will preface by saying that I had made a substitution to my sandwich (ordered it with pesto instead of sundried tomatoes) but it didn't matter much since it didn't have the taste of pesto anyway. I thought the garlic spread had a really strong flavor and there was way too much cheese. There was also an off taste to the sandwich ... I'm not sure what it was. After only a few bites, I was tired of it.\n\nThe cookies looked so tempting that even though I wasn't too impressed with my meal, I thought I'd give it a chance.

The second time, I ordered a chicken breast with asparagus in a cream sauce (alfredo) with a side of  Italian wedding soup.  The cream sauce was so bland that I had to dress it up with condiments on the table.  The soup was a big disappointment as well no flavor and too much orzo and not enough broth.

2,"I actually apologized to my dog for putting him through this ordeal. The first thing you notice is the horrible urine smell as soon as you walk through the door, from all the dogs in the play area. I was never asked for a copy of my dog's shot records. My dog is all of 10 pounds and other groomers take 2-3 hours from drop off to pick up. I was told they usually take a little longer but would call me. 6 hours later I finally called them and was told she was working on him now and he'd be ready soon. 6+ hours! If I'd known it would take that long I would have scheduled it for a day I worked and couldn't spend any time with him anyway. When I picked him up I was told that it had gotten a little rough that day and he'd gotten scratched in the play yard while waiting for his turn with the groomer butt that it wasn't a bad scratch because they never heard any yelping. First, I had never been told that he would be put in general population, with a mix of all sized dogs. I don't remember signing any release forms for it. Second, my dog is the king of all drama queens.  If you even look like you might be stepping on him, he yelps and screams, so I seriously doubt he kept quiet. Third, its not going to scar him or anything, but its bad enough that we're watching it for infections.\n\nThis experience really warrants less than two stars. However, I will say that the haircut my dog received is probably the best one he's ever had and he looks pretty dapper. So that's why the two stars.","i actually apologized to my dog for putting him through this ordeal. the first thing you notice is the horrible urine smell as soon as you walk through the door, from all the dogs in the play area. i was never asked for a copy of my dog's shot records. my dog is all of 10 pounds and other groomers take 2 3 hours from drop off to pick up. i was told they usually take a little longer but would call me. 6 hours later i finally called them and was told she was working on him now and he'd be ready soon. 6 hours! if i'd known it would take that long i would have scheduled it for a day i worked and couldn't spend any time with him anyway. when i picked him up i was told that it had gotten a little rough that day and he'd gotten scratched in the play yard while waiting for his turn with the groomer butt that it wasn't a bad scratch because they never heard any yelping. first, i had never been told that he would be put in general population, with a mix of all sized dogs. i don't remember signing any release forms for it. second, my dog is the king of all drama queens. if you even look like you might be stepping on him, he yelps and screams, so i seriously doubt he kept quiet. third, its not going to scar him or anything, but its bad enough that we're watching it for infections. n nthis experience really warrants less than two stars. however, i will say that the haircut my dog received is probably the best one he's ever had and he looks pretty dapper. so that's why the two stars.",297,"remorse, neutral, sadness","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'i actually apologized to my dog for putting him through this ordeal. the first thing you notice is the horrible urine smell as soon as you walk through the door, from all the dogs in the play area. i was never asked for a copy of my dog's shot records. my dog is all of 10 pounds and other groomers take 2 3 hours from drop off to pick up. i was told they usually take a little longer but would call me. 6 hours later i finally called them and was told she was working on him now and he'd be ready soon. 6 hours! if i'd known it would take that long i would have scheduled it for a day i worked and couldn't spend any time with him anyway. when i picked him up i was told that it had gotten a little rough that day and he'd gotten scratched in the play yard while waiting for his turn with the groomer butt that it wasn't a bad scratch because they never heard any yelping. first, i had never been told that he would be put in general population, with a mix of all sized dogs. i don't remember signing any release forms for it. second, my dog is the king of all drama queens. if you even look like you might be stepping on him, he yelps and screams, so i seriously doubt he kept quiet. third, its not going to scar him or anything, but its bad enough that we're watching it for infections. n nthis experience really warrants less than two stars. however, i will say that the haircut my dog received is probably the best one he's ever had and he looks pretty dapper. so that's why the two stars.'

2,"I literally got my nails done an hour ago and had a fill with gels. I've been going here for about 2 years but I won't be returning. My nails look like a teenager painted them (an actual comment my friend made when I asked how my nails looked). I don't know the name of the guy who did them, but I have had other technicians who have done a way better job. The guy did not put a top coat for my gels, just went straight to using a polish that turned out sloppy and lumpy. He didn't even paint all the way up to my cuticles (one of my biggest per peeves). I am so embarrassed that I had to book an appointment at a different nail salon so I can change it. The salon has been in the process of expanding and each time I come in, I see new employees. It seems to me like the guy was rushing to get my nails done and did not care about the quality of the work. On another note, there was a woman getting a pedicure who had her three young children (one was a baby) and her mother all occupying the couches/waiting area. The kids were being obnoxious and I had to listen to them the entire 45 minutes I had my pedicure. You would think with the expansion they would have a better area/ambiance/employees but it more about quantity over quality of work.

Comfy padded chairs. Brightly lit and seemed clean. \n\nHuge variety of flavors that night (17), two dairy free options and one NSA with cute names like \""Snickerdoodle: Tastes as happy as it sounds!\"" and \""Pineapple: Don't let the spikes fool you, it's tasty!\""\n\nIf there's one thing I despise about self-serve yogurt joints it's sample cup hoarders.

2,"I love BBQ. So I am always eager to try some new q. I was fairly disappointed. This place has the look and feel of a hipster restaurant but unfortunately it tastes like it to. There is no soul.\nWe split the 2 meet combo (shoulder & brisket). The shoulder was a small portion that came in a cast iron skillet. The meat was tender but lacked texture or bark, and it was diced into large clocks. The brisket was a mess. I still can't figure out how they sliced it. No visible smoke ring but you really couldn't tell because the place is dark like a cave.  Again lacking texture, and it was tender but super fatty.  I will say that my wife enjoyed the mac n cheese but the corn bread was overly sweet and greasy. The app menu was great we had fried chicken hearts. \n\nMy final issue was our service. Our server acted like our table of ten was bothering her although the place was dead that night.  Bottom line is it is Pittsburg, so I should have lower BBQ standards, but this was really lackluster even for Pittsburgh.","i love bbq. so i am always eager to try some new q. i was fairly disappointed. this place has the look and feel of a hipster restaurant but unfortunately it tastes like it to. there is no soul. nwe split the 2 meet combo shoulder brisket . the shoulder was a small portion that came in a cast iron skillet. the meat was tender but lacked texture or bark, and it was diced into large clocks. the brisket was a mess. i still can't figure out how they sliced it. no visible smoke ring but you really couldn't tell because the place is dark like a cave. again lacking texture, and it was tender but super fatty. i will say that my wife enjoyed the mac n cheese but the corn bread was overly sweet and greasy. the app menu was great we had fried chicken hearts. n nmy final issue was our service. our server acted like our table of ten was bothering her although the place was dead that night. bottom line is it is pittsburg, so i should have lower bbq standards, but this was really lackluster even for pittsburgh.",194,"disappointment, disapproval, love","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'i love bbq. so i am always eager to try some new q. i was fairly disappointed. this place has the look and feel of a hipster restaurant but unfortunately it tastes like it to. there is no soul. nwe split the 2 meet combo shoulder brisket . the shoulder was a small portion that came in a cast iron skillet. the meat was tender but lacked texture or bark, and it was diced into large clocks. the brisket was a mess. i still can't figure out how they sliced it. no visible smoke ring but you really couldn't tell because the place is dark like a cave. again lacking texture, and it was tender but super fatty. i will say that my wife enjoyed the mac n cheese but the corn bread was overly sweet and greasy. the app menu was great we had fried chicken hearts. n nmy final issue was our service. our server acted like our table of ten was bothering her although the place was dead that night. bottom line is it is pittsburg, so i should have lower bbq standards, but this was really lackluster even for pittsburgh.'

2,"My main issue with this place is the noise because it's still undergoing construction.  One of the main reasons I came to Vegas was to relax and catch up on sleep since I have a 1 year old and he never sleeps in.  Construction started at about 6:30 am and even though I was on the 18th floor the windows did a poor job of trying to muffle the noise.  They offered to switch us across the hall, but I opted out because if the noise travels up 18 floors I doubt walking across the hall would make much of a difference. I get the fact that when you're in Vegas you should be on the move out and about,  but there were times during the day I wanted to take a nap and was not able because it was so annoyingly loud!!!! The fact that I wasn't able to sleep passed 6:30 am because that's when construction started kills me.  If I wanted to wake up at 6:30 am I would have stayed home. A hotel that you can't sleep in is about as pointless as a rental car you can't drive. It just ends up being a huge waste of money.  I am only giving them 2 stars for customer service since we received a credit for 1 day of their resort fee charge.

2,"My personal meal deserves no stars, but since my co-workers all seemed to like their meals, and I will probably go again and try something else, I gave it two stars.\n\nMostly, the reason I felt compelled to add a review was as a warning.  Rubmi's take on tortilla soup is disgusting.  I gave it enough of a chance to try all the parts; the salty coconut broth, the fatty chicken and the clumpy mozzarella.  I honestly can't believe they put it on the menu because from construction to execution it is just awful.  The mozzarella clumps up so it is basically a blob of melted semi-warm cheese at the bottom.  Inedible.  The flavor of the broth made my stomach turn after a couple bites and it made its way to the trash can fast.  I don't remember the last time I would've asked for refund someplace, I usually just accept if I don't like something it is a matter of preference.

2,"Decent food at an affordable price. We came to eat here around 1am on a Friday night when we first arrived in Vegas. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. I shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because I wasn't too hungry. The steak was OK at best - it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium- but who's complaining for under $4? Hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. Overall everything was lacking in salt; understandable given the older crowd. OK place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery.","decent food at an affordable price. we came to eat here around 1am on a friday night when we first arrived in vegas. it was pretty busy but we were seated right away. i shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because i wasn't too hungry. the steak was ok at best it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium but who's complaining for under 4? hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. overall everything was lacking in salt understandable given the older crowd. ok place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery.",128,"neutral, approval, admiration","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'decent food at an affordable price. we came to eat here around 1am on a friday night when we first arrived in vegas. it was pretty busy but we were seated right away. i shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because i wasn't too hungry. the steak was ok at best it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium but who's complaining for under 4? hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. overall everything was lacking in salt understandable given the older crowd. ok place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery.'

1. Clarify the cuisine: Indo-Chinese cuisine is a fusion of Indian and Chinese cooking styles, which may be new to some customers. Providing a brief explanation of the cuisine and its unique characteristics can help set expectations.

2. Adjust sauce consistency: The customer found the dishes to be swimming in gooey sauces. To address this concern, we can work on adjusting the sauce consistency to be more balanced, ensuring that the flavors are well-represented without being overly soupy."
2,"Pretty disappointed. Came here with a friend and the fianc\u00e9 on my last trip to Vegas. We were tired of walking and wanted a bite to eat late at night. We saw the good reviews and though we'd give it a try. We ordered the jambalaya and ahi tuna tartare. The food fell below my expectations. I thought it would be similar to cheesecake factory, but the food was worse than than cheesecake factory for sure. \n\nFood: \nChicken jambalaya: pretty weird, but okay in taste. The chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side. \nAhi tuna tartare- Not the best. Didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but I'm a raw fish/sushi snob. \n\nPrice: pretty expensive for the quality. Similar to the cheesecake factory price wise.\n\nOverall, if your desperate and hungry and don't want to go off the strip maybe consider eating here, otherwise take your money and appetite off the strip. Some of the restaurants in the asian town are open pretty late.","pretty disappointed. came here with a friend and the fianc u00e9 on my last trip to vegas. we were tired of walking and wanted a bite to eat late at night. we saw the good reviews and though we'd give it a try. we ordered the jambalaya and ahi tuna tartare. the food fell below my expectations. i thought it would be similar to cheesecake factory, but the food was worse than than cheesecake factory for sure. n nfood nchicken jambalaya pretty weird, but okay in taste. the chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side. nahi tuna tartare not the best. didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but i'm a raw fish sushi snob. n nprice pretty expensive for the quality. similar to the cheesecake factory price wise. n noverall, if your desperate and hungry and don't want to go off the strip maybe consider eating here, otherwise take your money and appetite off the strip. some of the restaurants in the asian town are open pretty late.",190,"disappointment, annoyance, disapproval","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'pretty disappointed. came here with a friend and the fianc u00e9 on my last trip to vegas. we were tired of walking and wanted a bite to eat late at night. we saw the good reviews and though we'd give it a try. we ordered the jambalaya and ahi tuna tartare. the food fell below my expectations. i thought it would be similar to cheesecake factory, but the food was worse than than cheesecake factory for sure. n nfood nchicken jambalaya pretty weird, but okay in taste. the chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side. nahi tuna tartare not the best. didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but i'm a raw fish sushi snob. n nprice pretty expensive for the quality. similar to the cheesecake factory price wise. n noverall, if your desperate and hungry and don't want to go off the strip maybe consider eating here, otherwise take your money and appetite off the strip. some of the restaurants in the asian town are open pretty late.'

2,I went with a group to play this course for the 1st time since we had a free foursome. The other 3 in my group had played this course before. They were telling me in years past this was one of the best courses in Vegas. You definitely can't say that now. It was in just average condition and there isn't really anything special about the course. The staff was friendly and the beer was cold. You get your first beer after your round for the price of your score so that was nice. I wouldn't go out of my way to play this course but what the heck it was free.

2,"Stayed here recently for a conference. Check-in took forever. Nearly every person in line had a problem, everything from inaccurate quotes from the website, to unexpected room charges to who knows what.\n\nThe rooms are nice, full-wall windows, and bathrooms are absolutely huge. Though not that soundproofed, I could hear all sorts of activity from the hallway.\n\nFor a resort/spa hotel I really expected them to filter the water.

To improve the customer's experience at your establishment, consider the following steps:

1. Address the issue of the vanilla half and half: Ensure that you are using full-fat vanilla creamer consistently, and make it clear to customers that this is the case.

2. Improve service attitude: Train your staff to be friendly, welcoming, and attentive to customers, especially during closing times. A positive attitude can help turn around a customer's experience.

3. Stock inventory: Ensure that you have enough ice and soda available, especially during peak hours. Running out of essential items can negatively impact the customer's experience."

2,"The food is unique and very good. The decor in the new restaurant at Chandler Heights an Higley is Spartan. I have been to the new one 3 times.  The food screams comfort but the ambiance just screams. Too bright, uncomfortable and worst of all, there are always dirty tables. They have young kids waiting tables, but they aren't trained well. They bring your food one plate at a time, no silverware. When we finished both of the last two times they brought a dessert menu, came back and we declined dessert, then they went away and came back with the check, we paid and they collected the money - all the while never clearing our plates!

2,"We were craving pho after Tao but too lazy to head off the strip so we came here instead.  Surprisingly, they had their own version of pho called Zen Noodles.  It was like a \""fancy looking\"" pho, the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving, although really not worth $14.\n\nThe primary reason I'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible.  We got there around 3 AM, which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately.  After we gave our order though, we had to wait an eternity to get our food.  It was like that for all the tables next to us too.  Our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour.  I get that it's busy but I can't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table.  In total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 - 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting (for our food, for the bill, for them to take our credit card...).\n\nIf you're looking for a place to grub after clubbing, I'd recommend going someplace else like Earl of Sandwich instead.  You can get a great tasting meal in a few minutes and for half the price.","we were craving pho after tao but too lazy to head off the strip so we came here instead. surprisingly, they had their own version of pho called zen noodles. it was like a fancy looking pho, the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving, although really not worth 14. n nthe primary reason i'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible. we got there around 3 am, which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately. after we gave our order though, we had to wait an eternity to get our food. it was like that for all the tables next to us too. our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour. i get that it's busy but i can't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table. in total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting for our food, for the bill, for them to take our credit card... . n nif you're looking for a place to grub after clubbing, i'd recommend going someplace else like earl of sandwich instead. you can get a great tasting meal in a few minutes and for half the price.",265,"surprise, realization, neutral","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'we were craving pho after tao but too lazy to head off the strip so we came here instead. surprisingly, they had their own version of pho called zen noodles. it was like a fancy looking pho, the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving, although really not worth 14. n nthe primary reason i'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible. we got there around 3 am, which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately. after we gave our order though, we had to wait an eternity to get our food. it was like that for all the tables next to us too. our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour. i get that it's busy but i can't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table. in total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting for our food, for the bill, for them to take our credit card... . n nif you're looking for a place to grub after clubbing, i'd recommend going someplace else like earl of sandwich instead. you can get a great tasting meal in a few minutes and for half the price.'

2,"After a fantastic visit to the NY location four or five years ago, I was excited to eat at Scarpetta again. Unfortunately our experience at the Vegas location was a huge disappointment. The food was still delicious, but it was completely eclipsed by the terrible service we received, and we left with a bad taste in our mouths despite that scrumptious pomodoro. Our surly server wore a perpetual scowl, avoided our eyes when we tried to flag him down, and seemed eager to flee the table as soon as he unceremoniously dumped our food down, without waiting to see if we needed anything else. You would think he didn't WANT us to order more cocktails or courses. Getting a basket of that delicious bread proved extremely difficult, let alone a second one. Worst of all, towards the end of our meal, three of us had finished our entrees, but two of us were still eating our shared pasta, when the servers started clearing plates, including said hard-won bread basket. They literally cleared every plate from a six-top except the one we were eating from. WHAT?! No. Unacceptable. Rule no. 1. Do not clear until everyone has finished eating! I cringed for the waiter but I was also very disappointed and shocked to experience this kind of service at a high end, expensive restaurant. Needless to say we felt rushed out and couldn't savor the last bites of our meal because everyone else at the now empty table was sitting there twiddling their thumbs. Going to a nice restaurant isn't just about the food - it's about the service, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is true everywhere but especially in Vegas.

2,"We started out really excited to go to this place, but left feeling sort of deflated about the customer service. \n\nThe decor looked great, background music was a nice indie blend and the place was clean.\n\nWhen I asked our waitress about the beer selection and that I primarily prefer belgian and wheat ales, she said she couldn't really help me because she only liked hoppy beers since she started working there. She didn't tell me about any of the guest ales on tap (there was an Orange Blossom) or to even help to explain about any of the house beers that would have a low IBU (International Bitterness Units). So I ordered the house root beer. Not bad.\n\nWe ordered a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good, but then we waited and waited for the waitress to come around and ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), but she brought us the check (on a slow night with about 12 people in the restaurant) and left before we could even ask her about the desserts. My husband had to go over to the dessert case to get the owner to order our dessert for us.

2,"So I finally went out and experienced this valley staple that so many recommended to me.  My thoughts are summed up by the two star yelp description; Meh, I've experienced better.  What am I missing here? This food is not very good.  I guess if you like big portion's I do not), then that would be a positive note for this restaurant.  \n\nMy companion and I ordered a few different menu items, including the Chile Relleno, a Chimichanga and beef taco.  Let us start with the beef taco.  The appearance actually looked good. Crispy taco shell with colorful lettuce, tomato and cheese all over and the beef was decently cooked.  Unfortunately, the bottom of the taco had broken apart from the amount of oil, which make it hard to eat, but not bad.  The chimichanga was huge and covered with what seemed like three different sauces, and way too much of all three.  The chimi itself was not crunchy and totally lacking in flavor, most of it went un eaten.  \n\nI left the Chile Relleno description till the end, because this was nothing short of funny.  I have had Chile Relleno around fifty times in my life, minimum.  Never, ever ever, have I seen a plate of Chile Relleno look like this. You need to picture a football sized shell of some white substance with a plate of melted cheese below it. Seriously, it was bizarre and complete disgusting, dish was left completely untouched.  I am unsure how the kitchen lets a dish leave looking like that, totally revolting.\n\nAnyways, I am on my lonesome on this review, based on the fact there was an hour wait tonight on a Sunday and you cannot even get into the parking lot.

2,"On the positive side, the food was good and our waiter was very good. However, the food and wine was way overpriced. I noticed a few bottles that I am familiar with that were twice as much as other restaurants. While the food was good, it was a $35 steak, not a $55 steak. One other thing to mention is the ambiance.

The sauce was okay but no real spice or flavor, need more choices in sauces, fries soggy not fresh, frozen and not cooked well, coleslaw out of a box not fresh.

2,I was really looking forward to getting pizza from here as I've had it before and it was good.

2,I've been to this restaurant a few times now the first time was a good experience fast sitting no wait for drinks and not a long wait for food. The second time not so good I went on 4th. of July and it wasn't busy at all maybe 5 or 6 tables with people and 4 waitresses. So services should of been fast so you would think. We order our sons food first being 4 he has a small attention span when it comes to restaurants and places a like. After we order him eggs and toast we were told the waitress would come back in a few to get my wife and I's order. Well a few minutes turned in to 15 -20 minutes.

2,"So much on the menu here is just too needlessly expensive. Another victim of the \""Hey it's Vegas, charge 75% more than that would cost anywhere else\"" mentality. In my opinion, you're better off hogging as many free chips as you can (the three salsas were well liked by everyone) and ordering a salad. That formula should get you full enough while being budget friendly. The salad I got was the Watercross, Avocado and Orange salad. It was delicious once I got rid of the avocado. It came with three bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese that created a flavor fiesta in my mouth. We had a nice outdoor table on a patio that overlooked the impressive Mandalay Bay pool.

I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful.","i've been to this location a few times now, and i guess it's time for me to write a review of this place. honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the valley, trader joes is probably my least favorite. over the years, i've tried to like them..trust me, i've tried. i just can't get into the trader joe's scene. n nit's not one particular thing that turns me off about trader joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. for starters, i find thier food selection odd. mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter, and very little name brand stuff. i know i know, i don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that i prefer over others. plus, when i buy lunch meat, i want to go to a deli counter and get it, which they do not have. just prepackaged meats n cheeses. n ni tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour. their fair priced, and right there. the first few times i went here, i was getting a tuna sandwich on whitebread. i liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis. then, they stopped making it. why? i dunno, but i haven't seen it in like 3 weeks. just when i start liking something, it vanishes. now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches. n nas for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, i will probably never be a regular here. the reason i frequent this trader joe's is because its a close to my office, b there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and c thier staff is always friendly and helpful.",294,"disapproval, disappointment, annoyance","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'i've been to this location a few times now, and i guess it's time for me to write a review of this place. honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the valley, trader joes is probably my least favorite. over the years, i've tried to like them..trust me, i've tried. i just can't get into the trader joe's scene. n nit's not one particular thing that turns me off about trader joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. for starters, i find thier food selection odd. mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter, and very little name brand stuff. i know i know, i don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that i prefer over others. plus, when i buy lunch meat, i want to go to a deli counter and get it, which they do not have. just prepackaged meats n cheeses. n ni tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour. their fair priced, and right there. the first few times i went here, i was getting a tuna sandwich on whitebread. i liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis. then, they stopped making it. why? i dunno, but i haven't seen it in like 3 weeks. just when i start liking something, it vanishes. now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches. n nas for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, i will probably never be a regular here. the reason i frequent this trader joe's is because its a close to my office, b there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and c thier staff is always friendly and helpful.'

To improve the customer's experience, we can consider the following steps:

1. Address the food selection issue: Introduce more variety in the deli, meat counter, and name-brand items. This could help cater to customers who prefer certain brands or traditional grocery store offerings.

2. Maintain consistency in popular items: Ensure that popular items, such as the tuna sandwich on whitebread, remain available and don't disappear from the menu. If necessary, communicate any changes or discontinuations in advance to customers.

3. Improve communication: Keep customers informed about changes in the store, such as new items, discontinued items, or temporary unavailability of certain products."
2,"All of the men in my family thoroughly love Mexican food and I enjoy a good margarita so on our recent trip to Vegas we decided to try this restaurant which was described to us as \""upscale\"" Mexican.  The food was good but not great and not what I expected from two Top Chef Masters.  The good -  Service was very, very good.  The margaritas and cocktails, in general were fabulous and the guacamole was among some of the best I have tasted.  One of my guys had the oxacan strip steak and said it was delicious.  Now the bad -  I had the taquitos and they were tasteless and small.  My husband had the fish tacos and his verdict was that they were \""OK\"" but no better than what he can get at home (which is Dayton Ohio - a far piece from the border).  I forget what my Son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.  That would be OK but this place was pricey for what we got.  Now for the ugly - The place was dirty and the seating was uncomfortable.  We were also promised a \""view\"" when we elected to sit on the patio; however, the only people who get a view are the ones who sit in the very front of the patio.  We were at the very back of the patio. The overall appearance of the place just seemed to be chaotic and disorganized.  Not an enjoyable experience at all.

2,"I went for the first time ever on Tuesday night with a group of friends. We sat down to order food and drinks. It wasn't a particularly busy night, and workers were just standing around and goofing off. We sat at a table and the server did not seem excited in anyway to take our order. I ordered a beer that took over 5 minutes to get to me. There is no reason it should have taken so long. She also was slow at getting us more drinks when we were low. Our food arrived pretty quickly though and we chowed down. We were ready to play some games after the beer and food, but we ended up waiting and waiting for the server to come by. She never did so we ended up having to grab a manager to get our tab. BOOOO, BAD SERVICE. I was not impressed.\n\nThe games were a lot of fun, and the happy hour is a tremendous deal.

2,"I had really wanted to read past the reviews and like this place, but beyond the view, it did not live up to the owner's dream.  Putting their staff in tuxedos was as uncomfortable for me to see as for them to wear.  There was no pedigree in their training, beyond being polite, but polite is not what a tuxedo wears.  \""What can I get you guys...\""  and the minute a plate was near empty, a tuxedo would reach over you and yank it away.  You had to time your eating.\n\nI had an appetizer of escargot, and although generous in the portion, they were tasteless.  It needed seasoning, garlic, oil, butter, and white wine.\nFor dinner, I ordered Cavatappi Shrimp Natural.  Again, generous on the shrimp but tasteless.  It was pasta with shrimp. \n\nMy wife ordered a glass of house chardonnay and could not get past the first sip.  I tasted it and it was , honestly, undrinkable and I love finding cheap French wines. We had to get a $85 dollar William Hill Chardonnay to get through dinner.  Seriously ridiculous (400% markup)  My wife ordered their Hearts of iceberg appetizer with the hot bacon vinaigrette but it was so vinegary it was hard to eat and she could not finish it.

2,"A nice idea but brunch was at best, meh. The omelets are $10 and miniscule. I got the \""roasted vegetables\"" as a side, potatoes. They were tasteless and slightly undercooked.

1. Enhance Asian Influence in the Menu: The customer mentioned a lack of meaningful Asian influence in the dishes. We could consider incorporating more authentic Chinese and Southeast Asian flavors into our menu, similar to Red Farm in NYC.

2. Improve Server Training: The server seemed to lack experience and confidence, which affected the service. Providing more comprehensive training for our staff, including introducing themselves and asking if customers have dined at the restaurant before, could help improve the overall experience.

3. Food Presentation and Taste: The customer found the skate cheeks bland and the desserts poorly executed."

2,"We are staying at the Mirage and happened to walk by this restaurant which looks amazing from the outside. My wife and I are avid sushi fans and thought this would be a fun place to try out.

2,"I took a friend of mine out for her birthday last Friday (May 9th) and The White Chocolate Grill was her choice.  Neither of us had been there before but the menu looked very intriguing.

We envisioned something that would be at least visible.  She said that it was 'ok'.  I was probably more disappointed that she was because this was part of her birthday 'gift'.  \n\nFor desert we split the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.

2,"Absolutely appalling customer service. I waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and EVERY one they had in stock was also broken. Complete garbage. The staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. I watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. If you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy.","absolutely appalling customer service. i waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and every one they had in stock was also broken. complete garbage. the staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. i watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. if you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy.",70,"annoyance, disappointment, disgust","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'absolutely appalling customer service. i waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and every one they had in stock was also broken. complete garbage. the staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. i watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. if you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy.'

2,"It's not your mother's spa...it is your grandmother's spa. Literary. The resort is mostly occupied with senior citizens, though nothing is wrong with that. The spa is on the smaller side and looks old. It is also quite dark in comparison with other sun-infused Arizona spas. I was mildly grossed out seeing the toilet stalls adjacent to and facing the jacuzzi area, but, after consideration, it must be gerontologically-appropriate. To make matters better, there are two wheelchair-accessible showers strategically situated in between the toilets and the jacuzzi.   \nEverything else was uneventful and I did not stay long.","it's not your mother's spa...it is your grandmother's spa. literary. the resort is mostly occupied with senior citizens, though nothing is wrong with that. the spa is on the smaller side and looks old. it is also quite dark in comparison with other sun infused arizona spas. i was mildly grossed out seeing the toilet stalls adjacent to and facing the jacuzzi area, but, after consideration, it must be gerontologically appropriate. to make matters better, there are two wheelchair accessible showers strategically situated in between the toilets and the jacuzzi. neverything else was uneventful and i did not stay long.",100,"neutral, approval, disapproval","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'it's not your mother's spa...it is your grandmother's spa. literary. the resort is mostly occupied with senior citizens, though nothing is wrong with that. the spa is on the smaller side and looks old. it is also quite dark in comparison with other sun infused arizona spas. i was mildly grossed out seeing the toilet stalls adjacent to and facing the jacuzzi area, but, after consideration, it must be gerontologically appropriate. to make matters better, there are two wheelchair accessible showers strategically situated in between the toilets and the jacuzzi. neverything else was uneventful and i did not stay long.'

To improve the customer's experience, we could consider the following changes:

1. Modernize the spa's appearance: Update the decor to make it more contemporary and inviting, possibly with a lighter color scheme and more modern fixtures.

2. Address the lighting: Improve the lighting in the spa to make it brighter and more welcoming, especially during the daytime hours.

3. Separate toilet and jacuzzi areas: Consider redesigning the layout to separate the toilet stalls from the jacuzzi area, as this may be a source of discomfort for some customers."
2,"The food was good and the decor/ ambiance was great but the service sucked big time. My friend and I came here after being down at the farmers market. We were both visiting madison from out of town and wanted to eat somewhere that used local ingredients. Yelp came to the rescue and we evaded over to the Mermaid Cafe . I order d the California BLT and my friend got the chicken pesto panini. We took our seats and waited.........and waited........and waited. 25 minutes later I went up to the counter to see what the deal was and they were JUST plating our food. WHAT?!?!?!?  We didn't order a steak , we order simple sandwiches that take 7 minutes to make. I told the gal at the counter that we had been waiting for 25 minutes for sandwiches which was ridiculous. There was no offer of a free drink or free dessert nothing. Would love to go back and the food was great but the service was def sub par","the food was good and the decor ambiance was great but the service sucked big time. my friend and i came here after being down at the farmers market. we were both visiting madison from out of town and wanted to eat somewhere that used local ingredients. yelp came to the rescue and we evaded over to the mermaid cafe . i order d the california blt and my friend got the chicken pesto panini. we took our seats and waited.........and waited........and waited. 25 minutes later i went up to the counter to see what the deal was and they were just plating our food. what?!?!?!? we didn't order a steak , we order simple sandwiches that take 7 minutes to make. i told the gal at the counter that we had been waiting for 25 minutes for sandwiches which was ridiculous. there was no offer of a free drink or free dessert nothing. would love to go back and the food was great but the service was def sub par",171,"admiration, neutral, annoyance","[INST] A customer left us a 2-star review: 'the food was good and the decor ambiance was great but the service sucked big time. my friend and i came here after being down at the farmers market. we were both visiting madison from out of town and wanted to eat somewhere that used local ingredients. yelp came to the rescue and we evaded over to the mermaid cafe . i order d the california blt and my friend got the chicken pesto panini. we took our seats and waited.........and waited........and waited. 25 minutes later i went up to the counter to see what the deal was and they were just plating our food. what?!?!?!? we didn't order a steak , we order simple sandwiches that take 7 minutes to make. i told the gal at the counter that we had been waiting for 25 minutes for sandwiches which was ridiculous. there was no offer of a free drink or free dessert nothing. would love to go back and the food was great but the service was def sub par' The customer feels admiration, neutral, annoyance.

The NPS is based on the idea that customers who are promoters are more likely to recommend a product or service, while customers who are detractors are less likely to do so. By calculating the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors, we can determine the overall NPS score.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'i'd never had these guys, and they had good reviews, so i was excited to try them out. n ni called and asked if they could deliver downtown. they said yes, but they were slammed, so it would take 45 minutes . n ni said that's totally okay, then ordered. n nan hour later i got a phone call telling me that they wouldn't be able to get it to me in any sort of reasonable time, and asked me if i could come pick it up instead. quite upset, i said nevermind. n ni order delivery for a reason because i don't want to get in my car and go anywhere. if i was willing to do takeout, i'd just dine in. n nif i'd just been told initially that no, they're too busy to do delivery at the moment , that would have been perfectly fine. but making me wait an hour to tell me that i was sol makes me furious. n ni guess i'll never know if your pizza's any good, pizza a metro.'

One way to do this is by using a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS). NPS helps us measure how likely customers are to recommend a company to others. To calculate NPS, we ask customers a simple question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"" Customers who answer 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those who answer 7 or 8 are considered passives, and those who answer 0 to 6 are considered detractors. NPS is a great tool because it helps us understand the overall sentiment of our customers.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'this restaurant is super loud. while we were there, there was karaoke, music trivia and a congo line. there are also ballon animal makers and photographers. it's a great atmosphere for the kids and twenty somthings...not so much for those of us who are older. n nwe had margaritas which are supposed to be a specialty. they were just ok. n nwe ordered tortilla soups as an appetizer and steak fajitas to share. n nthe soup was fantastic! the fajitas were not great. the steak was very tough and there wasn't much of it. n nthey many signs are fun to read.'

Response: ","1. Train staff on proper tipping etiquette: Ensure bartenders understand that asking about tips in front of customers is not appropriate. They should focus on providing excellent service and encourage customers to leave generous tips voluntarily.

This can help prevent situations where customers feel pressured to continue gambling after losing a significant amount of money.

The survey results are then used to create a score for each company. The score is based on how well the company is doing in each area of customer experience. The higher the score, the better the company is doing.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'this place is terrible! mindy is a crook. she is sweet as pie, until she adds as much money as possible to your bill! when you ask why it's more expensive than she quoted, she yells and tries to embarrass you into paying! if you are looking for a place that will treat you like crap or be as sweet as possible to guilt you into spending more this is your spot.'

By analyzing the EVI scores, we can gain insights into how customers feel about a particular brand or product. For example, let's consider a customer who had a negative experience with a brand.

One way to measure this is by using a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS). NPS helps us understand how likely a customer is to recommend a company to others. To calculate NPS, we ask customers a simple question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"" Customers who respond with a score of 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those who respond with a score of 7 or 8 are considered passives, and those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are considered detractors.

One way to do this is by using a tool called the Emotional Value Index (EVI). The EVI helps us measure the emotional impact of a customer's experience and identify areas for improvement. The EVI is based on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very negative and 5 being very positive. It takes into account both the positive and negative emotions a customer feels during their interaction with a company. By analyzing the EVI scores, we can gain valuable insights into how customers perceive our services and identify areas where we can make improvements. Let's take a look at an example to better understand how the EVI works.","A customer left us a 3-star review: 'i've been wanting to try simon and generally drive by without thinking about it. yesterday, i went for a late breakfast. my first reaction to the palms place was that it's dark!! i found the elevators and made it to the 6th floor where simon is located. n nthere were two other parties in the restaurant and we all were seated in different sections so i had the main dining area to myself. i asked to be seated along the windows to enjoy the view and watch the pool area. little did i know, there would be some crazy tourists who came out and got in the heated jacuzzi. he tried the main pool for about 15 seconds and then went back to the heated water. n ni was brought coffee quickly and it was refilled several times during my time there. my server was christy and she was great! i ordered the peaches and cream pancakes. they're three large pancakes with some peach compote and whipped cream on top. its' too bad they didn't have a short stack order because these cakes are large and filling. i left half on my plate rather than stuff myself. n nbreakfast was fine and enjoyed the sunshine and the view of the pool.'

Italian Hoagie: For the Italian Hoagie, we can offer a variety of dressings to enhance the flavor and provide a tangy taste as expected. 3. Hot Sausage Hoagie: To prevent the bread from getting soggy, we could use a drier bread or find a way to balance the moisture content in the sausage and the bread.","In the world of customer service, it is important to understand how customers feel about the products and services they receive. One way to do this is by using a tool called the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI). The CSI measures how satisfied customers are with a company's performance. To calculate the CSI, we need to look at the number of positive and negative comments that customers leave. Positive comments are when customers say they are satisfied with the company, while negative comments are when customers say they are dissatisfied. We can then divide the number of positive comments by the total number of comments to get the CSI score. For example, let's say a company receives 100 comments from customers. Out of those 100 comments, 80 are positive and 20 are negative.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'there are only so many ways to make the american bastardized version of a pizza, but for some reason there are as many pizza shops as there are stars in a clear night sky. as they may be stunning to behold, from afar each one is pretty much the same thing. this shop is another place that tosses sauce and cheese on bread and serves it to their patrons. ok, so they do have a slightly different take, throwing the cold shredded cheese onto the pie as soon as the dough is out of the oven. this does not melt the cheese, and i do see how the pizza would be cold after heaping on the cheese. some customers may like it, me, not so much. i tried the italian hoagie. it was a good size and the meat was flavorful. but that's about it. they put oil on the sandwich, but no other dressing. i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. i didn't sample it, he liked it, but it was way too messy. the bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich. the staff did seem pretty nice, even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant. the dining room is also a bit cramped. there are plenty of booths, but the tables are rather close together and hard to maneuver between. hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain. when they are busy, it is a claustrophobic nightmare.'

The NPS is based on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ""not at all likely"" and 10 being ""extremely likely."" Customers who rate their likelihood of recommending a product or service as 9 or 10 are considered promoters, while those who rate it as 0 to 6 are considered detractors. The remaining customers are classified as passive.

It says that people are more likely to do something if they believe it will lead to a positive outcome. For example, if a customer is annoyed with a product, they may be more likely to stop using it and find a different one.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'this is the original macayo's and man has it seen better days. the decor is old. the carpeting is tired. the plates are chipped and scratched up. the service is crap and the food is not what it is at other macayo's around town. it took our server 10 minutes to come and get our drink order. one member of our party ordered a coke and it was totally flat. it took her another 10 minutes to replace it. i had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned. the server spilled salsa all over the table and took forever to come back to clean it up. one member of our party ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and got a beef and green chili burrito with verde sauce...and then our server seemed befuddled when we asked for her to replace it with what we actually ordered. n nhonestly, i have eaten in better dive mexican places than this macayos. definitely skip this spot.'

One way to measure this is through customer satisfaction surveys. These surveys ask customers to rate their satisfaction with a company's products or services on a scale of 1 to 5.

This is where the concept of customer experience comes into play. Customer experience refers to the overall impression a customer has of a company based on their interactions with the company's products, services, and employees.

These emotions can range from positive to negative and can greatly impact the overall experience. One way to analyze customer emotions is through the use of sentiment analysis, which involves analyzing text data to determine the sentiment behind it.

One way to do this is by using a tool called the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS helps us measure how likely customers are to recommend a company to their friends and family. To calculate the NPS, we ask customers a simple question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or family member?"" Customers who answer 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those who answer 7 or 8 are considered passives, and those who answer 0 to 6 are considered detractors. The NPS is a valuable tool because it helps us understand the overall satisfaction of our customers.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'my pad thai was very sweet and had no discernible spice at all. the chicken seemed to be of low quality. i also ordered a side of fried rice which was bland and unappealing. finally, the mango smoothie which has been good in the past tasted like ice cream this time. n ni have never enjoyed the food on previous visits, but everyone raves about lulu's, so i keep trying to give it a chance. i am consistently let down, so i don't think i'll be visiting lulu's ever again.'

They were excited to try Mexican food, but their experience was disappointing.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'went there to celebrate with some friends and i was excited to try some mexican food something i'd been missing since i moved from san diego to pittsburgh. since there was a long wait we got margaritas and waited for the tables. i got a strawberry margarita, but the flavor was unnecessary as all i could taste was cheap, nasty tequila. gross. to mitigate the taste and try not to be sloshed before dinner we asked for some chips and salsa while we waited. when we finally got some 15 minutes later i was buzzed and disappointed. the chips and salsa were worse than even the store brand from the supermarket. my opinion, if a mexican food restaurant can't do the good chips and salsa and margaritas, i don't even want to try anything else. we paid our tab and left before our table was even ready. no thank you.'

Response: ","1. Improve the cooking process: The customer mentions that the food is brought out to the table, which can be a challenge in a restaurant setting. To improve the customer's experience, consider implementing a more efficient cooking process that allows for meats to be ready when ordered. This could involve pre-cooking certain items or adjusting cooking times to ensure everything is ready at the same time.
2. Adjust the sauce: The customer found the house bbq sauce to be too overpowering, especially on the turkey and sausage. Consider reducing the amount of sauce used or offering a separate sauce option for customers who prefer less sauce.
3. Enhance the wings: The customer found the wings to be oversmoked and lacking chipotle flavor. To improve the wings, consider reducing the smoking time and adjusting the seasoning to enhance the chipotle flavor without making it too overpowering."

However, if the customer has used this coupon before and it has always been accepted, they may feel disapproving because they feel like they are being treated unfairly.","A customer left us a 3-star review: 'my family visits this location quite often. the food is usually quite good. however, more than once we've had an issue trying to use a coupon. case in point, yesterday checked in on yelp and was rewarded a free onion wing app, only to be informed by our waitress that they weren't accepting coupons that day presumably because of mother's day? . as stated before, not the first time a coupon has been refused here. not sure what the thinking is behind these decisions, but seems a bit off putting. it's not like they're giving anything else away. maybe change the wording on offers to exclude certain days, but seems to me a bad idea to treat customers in that manner.'

This could help create a more professional and sophisticated atmosphere. 3. Communicate more effectively the variety of experiences available at Chase Field, ensuring that all fans are aware of the options available to them. This could help prevent the perception that the stadium is overly focused on children's activities.","In the world of customer service, it is important to understand the emotions and feelings of customers. One way to do this is by using a tool called the Emotional Value Index (EVI). The EVI helps us measure the emotional impact of a customer's experience. Imagine a customer who had a great experience with a company. They were happy and satisfied with the service they received. In this case, the EVI would be high, indicating a positive emotional impact. On the other hand, if a customer had a negative experience, the EVI would be low, indicating a negative emotional impact. To calculate the EVI, we use a formula that takes into account the customer's emotional state and the overall experience.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'i like chase field, but the diamondbacks have way too many amateur hour activities. there are so many contests geared toward children, it's like being at a single a baseball game. you're a professional sports franchise, act like it. as a kid i loved going to baseball games because i love baseball. if i needed a lame activities to keep my happy my parents wouldn't have taken me to games, they'd have taken me to a circus. it's time phoenix starts acting like it's the 7th biggest metro area in the country, instead of a second rate city.'

One way to do this is by using a tool called the Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ). EQ helps us understand how customers feel and how we can make them feel better. Imagine a customer who is upset because they had a bad experience at a restaurant. They might feel angry, frustrated, or disappointed. As a customer service representative, it is important to be empathetic and understanding. We can use our EQ to put ourselves in the customer's shoes and try to understand their emotions. For example, if a customer is upset because their food was cold, we can apologize and offer to have it reheated.","A customer left us a 3-star review: 'this is definitely a townie bar. because of the apartments next door, it's almost like cheers on some nights just a bunch of regulars sitting around drinking. this bar is definitely not trendy. personally, i like it that way. the food is good, the drinks are cheap, and if you live in the south end area, you can't beat the location. carissa is really the only bartender that's any good though. she's the type that already has your next drink waiting for you before you've finished the one you're on. the others are slow and kind of standoffish. if you want a bar just to go, watch a game, grab some food, and just relax, this is a great bar to go to. it never gets super crowded outside of the buffalo sport nights and everyone there makes you feel right at home. i would avoid the bar like the plague whenever teams from buffalo are playing unless you're a buffalo fan , those people are obnoxious!'

One way to do this is by using a tool called the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS helps us measure how likely customers are to recommend a company to others. To calculate the NPS, we ask customers a simple question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"" Customers who answer 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those who answer 7 or 8 are considered passives, and those who answer 0 to 6 are considered detractors. The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'whatever einstein bros. serves, it is not a bagel. bagels are boiled, and einstein serves up a round, puffy, baked roll with a hole in the middle. no boiling involved, since that is time consuming, i.e., expensive, and creates real bagels with a chewy consistency. n nyou might like their rolls, but they really shouldn't call them bagels.'

Response: ","Dear Customer,
Thank you for your feedback on our products, specifically the Einstein Bros. Bagels. We appreciate your honesty and understand your concerns regarding the baking process and the term 'bagels.' We aim to provide high-quality, authentic bagels that are boiled to achieve a chewy consistency. However, we understand that this process may be time-consuming and expensive, which could explain why we serve a round, puffy, baked roll with a hole in the middle instead. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. To address your concerns and improve your experience, we could consider offering a wider variety of baked goods, including bagels, that are boiled and have a chewy consistency. Additionally, we could provide more information about our baking process and the different types of products we offer to help customers make informed choices. Thank you for your feedback, and we hope to serve you better in the future."

One way to do this is by using a tool called the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS helps us measure how likely customers are to recommend a company to others. To calculate the NPS, we ask customers a simple question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"" Customers who answer 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those who answer 7 or 8 are considered passives, and those who answer 0 to 6 are considered detractors. The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'i went to big earl's yesterday because, unfortunately, bryan's bbq across the street was closed. my daughter ordered the kid's meal chicken fingers with fries and a drink. i ordered the kid's meal grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and a drink. n nthe girl behind the counter is very friendly, yes. but that doesn't change the fact that they use styrofoam cups step it up for the environment! , or that the sweet potato fries were dry and stale, or that the grilled cheese had maybe one slice of cheese for the whole sandwich and was a bit burned. n nmy daughter could not eat because she was so appalled at all the different types of flies crawling on the windows inside . she is 8 years old, and said mom, this place is disgusting. they don't even clean the floors, and there are crumbs inbetween the seats here . i think that says it all when a child can see how filthy a place is. one fly landed on her little cup of ketchup...on the ketchup. shuddering at the memory . n nfor me to like a place, it has to be free of insects crawling inches from my food, or even on my food. i have had better fries at fast food joints, which is sad. and, furthermore, my daughter refuses to go back. n nnot good.'

One way to do this is by using a tool called the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI). The CSI measures how satisfied customers are with a company's products or services. It is calculated by asking customers to rate their satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10. The CSI is a valuable tool because it helps companies identify areas where they can improve. For example, if the CSI shows that customers are not satisfied with the quality of a product, the company can work on improving the product to meet customer expectations. Similarly, if the CSI shows that customers are not satisfied with the customer service they receive, the company can train its employees to provide better service.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'absolutely atrocious service, while there were only three tables of customers at 7pm on a saturday night. to top it off, the waiter was a smart ass when, after 15 minutes of his being mia, we inquired as to his whereabouts when we wished to order more drinks food. on the plus side, the food was fine and arrived quickly even before the chips and salsa appetizer? .'

It is a process that is influenced by the customer's expectations, the service provider's actions, and the interaction between the two. In order to improve the customer's experience, it is important to understand the factors that influence it. The first factor is the customer's expectations. Customers have certain expectations when they interact with a service provider. These expectations are based on their past experiences and their perceptions of the service provider. If the service provider meets or exceeds these expectations, the customer is likely to have a positive experience. If the service provider fails to meet these expectations, the customer is likely to have a negative experience. The second factor is the service provider's actions. The service provider's actions can have a significant impact on the customer's experience.

For example, if we see that many customers are saying they are very satisfied with a product, we can assume that the product is doing well. On the other hand, if we see that many customers are saying they are very dissatisfied, we can assume that there may be some issues with the product. But it's not just about the overall satisfaction level. We can also look at specific aspects of the product or service.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'day 2 of chronic alcoholism. n nlike omgz, criss angel's bday party! n nlike omg who the funk cares. n ndance floor was basically a hallway. n it was so packed that i smacked a girl for elbowing me and she apologized for running into my arm. ni think my 14 year old cousin has a better playlist than lax. mash ups are cool when you can continuously dance to a song without fear of a sporadic hoe down in the middle of it. don't play hyphy music with 80s cyndi lauper. your girl has enough trouble tryin' to dance in 4 inch hells. i mean heels. n nso uh yeah. if you could find another club to go to that night, go to the other club. however, there is a 24 hour mcdonald's in the luxor. n...and that's the best part of lax.'

Balancing the amount of time spent on national shows like Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, ensuring it doesn't overshadow local content. 4. Expanding the coverage of major local firms in our business news segment. 5. Providing more local arts stories that are not just about British musicians playing in town.","In this section, we will learn about customer feedback and how it can help improve services. Customer feedback is when people share their thoughts and opinions about a product or service. It is important for companies to listen to customer feedback because it can help them understand what customers like and what they don't like. Sometimes, customers may have different opinions about a product or service. For example, one customer may think that a company's schedule of national shows is good, while another customer may think that the local content is weak. It is important for companies to consider all feedback, even if it is negative, because it can help them make improvements. Let's look at an example of customer feedback. One customer left a review saying that they are neutral about the company's services.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'four stars for their schedule of national shows good schedule choices most of the best national public radio shows . one star for their local content. i'm rounding down to two stars, though, since i can stream national shows i don't need a local station for that. n nlocal content is pretty weak with the exception of the allegheny front . most of their news time is spent on local press releases, leaving little time for coverage of stories that might actually have an impact on listeners. they also do this annoying thing of eating up big chunks of morning edition during the week by playing whole segments from wait wait don't tell me. their flagship noon current events show, essential pittsburgh, spends most of its time covering issues that have little pittsburgh pa connection seriously doubt that 1 3 of the show's time is spent on local stories. don't get me wrong lots of the guests are local, but that doesn't magically turn a national or international issue into a pittsburgh story. ...and a british musician playing a show in town is not a local arts story. the show's business news rarely covers major local firms, and their travel segments are mostly on destinations outside of western pa. n nso, everything you can get by streaming other npr stations is good. the piece that can only be provided by a local station actual, relevant local content is sorely missing.' The customer feels neutral, annoyance, disapproval. Concisely, how can we best improve our services for this customer's experience?
Response: ","1. Strengthen local content: Improve the quality and quantity of local news, events, and stories that have a direct impact on Pittsburgh listeners. This could involve dedicating more time to local press releases, covering local issues, and featuring more local guests."

Customers who answer with a score of 9 or 10 are called promoters, those who answer with a score of 6 or 7 are called passives, and those who answer with a score of 0 to 5 are called detractors.

One way to do this is by using a tool called the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI). The CSI measures how satisfied customers are with a company's products or services. It helps companies identify areas where they can improve and make their customers happier. To calculate the CSI, companies ask customers to rate their satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10. The average rating is then used to determine the overall satisfaction level. For example, if the average rating is 8, it means that most customers are satisfied with the company's products or services. But how do companies know if their customers are satisfied or not?

One way to do this is by using a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS). NPS helps us measure how likely customers are to recommend a business to others. To calculate NPS, we ask customers a simple question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our business to a friend or colleague?"" Customers who answer 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those who answer 7 or 8 are considered passives, and those who answer 0 to 6 are considered detractors. NPS is a valuable tool because it helps us understand the overall satisfaction of our customers. It allows us to identify areas where we excel and areas where we need to improve.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'the sheer number of yelp reviews had me intrigued, but my experience was that this place may be a bit over rated. not a dinner place in my humble opinion. lots of interesting bar food, and a well stocked bar, but way too dark inside. n nwe must have been there too early 6 30 for the music others have mentioned. n ni think two stars sums it up fairly.'

For example, if a customer is unhappy with the food at a restaurant, the business can offer to bring them a new dish or refund their money. Another way to improve customer service is by being friendly and helpful. When a customer walks into a store or calls a business, the employees should greet them with a smile and offer assistance.","A customer left us a 1-star review: 'don't normally feel like gee i wish we hadn't ate there but that is just how we left after dinner this past wednesday. the food all looked like it was left there since lunch. the soup was so crusty and dark i mentioned to a waitress that happened by and she mentioned it to the owner. i simply asked if she would eat that soup there on buffet . the owner came and had a new bin of soup brought out. the crab legs were good but all watery and stuck to the shells which is an indication they are not fresh. the salad bar area did not have the usual asian salad only some dark almost black sea weed salad. the fruit was all dried out i had to roll the oranges in the water to soften them up and the ice cream machine was out of order ... so i don't think for 24.99 it was a good experience for me. the food was sub par for the price the waitress was clearly uninterested in us. i did manage to find one gal who continued to check on us after she helped with the soup debacle... she continued to make sure we were okay so when it came time for the tip she got it though she was not the waitress at our table take always ...? don't eat there mid week the food is old and doesn't get refreshed with new food... save your money and go to wan fu !'

They mentioned that the sushi rolls had strange spices and the ginger dressing on the salad was odd. The customer also mentioned that the gyoza was the only good thing they ordered. They were disappointed with the overall experience and felt that the restaurant's service was subpar.

Sometimes, customers may feel annoyed, scared, or disgusted. These emotions can make them want to leave a bad review or not come back to a business. It is important for businesses to listen to their customers and try to make things right. One way to improve customer service is by using a tool called a customer service scorecard. This tool helps businesses keep track of how well they are doing in terms of customer satisfaction. It can also help them identify areas where they need to improve.

This will help prevent situations where one customer receives a smaller or less appetizing portion than others. 2. Communication with the kitchen: Encourage the kitchen staff to communicate more effectively with the waitstaff about the quality and size of the dishes being served. This will help address any issues before they reach the customer. 3. Provide appropriate cutlery: Offer appropriate cutlery for dishes that require it, such as the country fried steak.","In the world of customer service, it is important to understand how customers feel about their experiences. One way to do this is by using a tool called the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS is a simple question that asks customers to rate their likelihood of recommending a company or product to others. The NPS is based on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ""not at all likely"" and 10 being ""extremely likely."" Customers who rate their likelihood of recommending a company or product as 9 or 10 are considered promoters, while those who rate it as 7 or 8 are considered passives. Customers who rate it as 0 to 6 are considered detractors. The NPS is a valuable metric because it provides insights into customer satisfaction and loyalty.","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'came here with a large group 12 of us on a saturday around 1pm. we were seated in about 15 20 minutes which isn't bad. n nthe 2 stars essentially came from my specific dish. i ordered the country fried steak as did two other people at my table. they loved theirs, and i'm sure i would too if it didn't take me 5 minutes to cut off a piece of mine. i'm not asking for them to give each person a steak knife i'm asking you not to give me a horrible piece of meat while the other two people got the good pieces at my table. i don't understand why it would take me twice as long to chew my food as it did for me to cut it. i left the place hungry because all i ate was th strawberry, eggs, and toast that came with this dish. why i am paying so much to leave hungry? i even ate someone's leftover grilled cheese and soup.'

To improve the customer's experience, consider the following steps: 1.

Train staff on customer service: Provide additional training to your staff on customer service, focusing on empathy, patience, and clear communication. In this case, the waitress could have handled the situation more effectively by acknowledging the customer's concerns and offering a solution, such as a discount or a complimentary item for the toddler."

3," A customer left us a 3-star review: 'it looks like stations casinos brought back the grand cafe. i didn't have high expectations upon entering this place, since i remember the old grand cafe being pretty terrible. n nfirst thing that i noticed was that they're really trying to emphasize better service. staff is much more friendly and accommodating this time around, which is already an improvement. i never really expected to be greeted with smiling faces and a friendly welcome when i'm in the boulder station. i mean, c'mon, it's the boulder station. the boulder strip doesn't exactly scream with class. n nthe menu did go through some minor tweaks, but it still contains the standard cafe fare, with 7.99 daily specials that come with soup or salad. they also have some off menu specials like a 3.99 skillet breakfast, 5.99 burger special, or 7.99 for a mountain of rocky road pancakes. n nfor starters, we ordered some spinach artichoke dip, served with pita bread. wasn't too bad, seemed a little lighter than most spinach dips that i have had. n nfor the entr u00e9e, i ordered the potato crusted trout special, one of the friday specials. it practically looked like a two rectangular hash browns with trout hiding inside. it wasn't too bad actually, especially for a 8 seafood dish. n nthey tout that their kona coffee is freshly brewed and ground every 90 minutes, which got me interested in trying it out. i'm no coffee connoisseur, but it tasted good enough for me. n nall in all, a decent experience. this is somewhere i'd go for lazy and cheap eating, when i'm not willing to make a drive anywhere to break the bank. it's decent food, but nothing to go out of the way for. it's a definite improvement over the old grand cafe, that's for sure.'

3," A customer left us a 3-star review: 'i'm not a big fan of the concept of the walmart neighborhood market according to walmart, it's supposed to woo shoppers with easier parking, less crowded aisles and quicker checkout. i can see how that would be appealing to someone who treats walmart supercenter as the place to do their primary grocery shopping. in that case, the individual would probably welcome the opportunity to skip out on the toys, electronics, home goods, and massive lines that characterize your average super walmart. they would probably be thrilled with the fact that this version of walmart maintains the low prices but downsizes the space and speeds up checkout and for that matter, has self checkout, which larger walmarts do not . n nhowever, since i shop for groceries elsewhere my love, fresh and easy, or fry's , only get food at walmart if i'm also there shopping for other things, and see walmart as a place to find home goods paper products, cat food, towels at really low prices, the neighborhood market doesn't really serve my needs. when i went to this location last night to check it out on the day of its grand opening, i discovered that the selection of non food home goods is pretty small. as an example, they only had 2 3 brands of cat food. they also didn't have hard alcohol only wine and beer , and the deli selection looked pretty slim. n nto sum it up, if you frequent larger walmarts for food, limited house goods, and the pharmacy, you will appreciate having a downsized version of the store. if you like going to walmart to find a really large selection of every kind of product, you will probably not find the neighborhood market too useful.'

2," A customer left us a 2-star review: 'after hearing good things about this place, i finally made it here for lunch. unfortunately, it was after the menu change so i was expecting different choices. n nupon entering, the first thing i noticed was that there wasn't much space to sit. there were maybe 5 small tables near the ordering counter and just as much at the patio. this was a fast casual place you order at the counter but they'll bring food out to you . the menu was somewhat small. you get to pick between pizza, salad, or sandwich. i decided on a gyro and my bf got the corn pizza. since we wanted to sit inside, we decided to go past the ordering counter to see if there were any tables there. i was skeptical since all i could see was the kitchen and waitstaff in that area, but it turned out there was a ton of restaurant seating that you can't see when you go in. we weren't sure if we were suppose to sit there since it looked more formal, but we did anyway. the food came within a reasonable amount of time and it was decent. my gyro was generously portioned. the pickle that came with my gyro could have been more crisp and the tzatziki sauce was pretty bland. the corn pizza was also a generous portion and seemed quite good from the bite i got. n nmy main dislike of this place was the layout. seating shouldn't be hidden in the back. the food is slightly pricey and none of the menu items jumped out at me. i'd describe this place as underwhelming. at least this place has underground parking.'

","A customer left us a 2-star review: 'i have never written a review, but the food at havana cafe was so underwhelming and not in the least bit good that i feel compelled to share. ni ordered the pollo ajillo which, in reality, was a pile of salt with a side of chicken and rice. i opted for arroz con gandules instead of white rice as it has been years since i have had this tasty puerto rican side. the whole thing was almost inedible... i came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad! my husband had the pollo cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves. the restaurant gets an extra star for the wonderful cafe cubano and the extremely attentive wait staff . i had high hopes for this place but the next time i have a craving for cuban food, i will be heading to sabor cubano.' The customer feels disappointment, disapproval, annoyance. Concisely, how can we best improve our services for this customer's experience? To improve the customer's experience at Havana Cafe, consider the following steps: 1. Revise the Pollo Ajillo recipe to ensure it is seasoned appropriately and not excessively salty. 2.

Consider offering a taste test or adjusting the dish based on the customer's preference for spiciness or saltiness. 4. Train kitchen staff on proper seasoning techniques and encourage them to taste dishes before serving. 5. Offer a variety of Cuban dishes that cannot be easily replicated at home, such as traditional side dishes or unique entrees."
